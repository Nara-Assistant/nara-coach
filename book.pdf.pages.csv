Page 2,"Module 1.1: Cellular respiration The first step in helping the body detox from various health harming compounds that are present in copious amounts in today’s society and heal from their negative effects, is focusing on optimizing one’s metabolism. It does not matter what your current health struggles might be. It does not matter if you entered this course to improve depression, anxiety, low libido, hair loss, hair thinning, gray hair, wrinkles, struggling to put on lean muscle mass, struggling to lose fat, sleep problems, digestive issues, low testosterone, migraines, ADD, ADHD, chronic fatigue, migraines, epilepsy, problems with your eye vision, productivity problems, thyroid problems or fertility. Everything is connected with our metabolic health and if we don’t focus on optimizing it, it will be like putting on bandaids. The first step in improving every health condition is understanding the basic principles of metabolic health and how to optimize it. This will not be a short journey but it will provide you with the tools you need in order to transform your health once and for all but also your life as a direct result of this. *Standard disclaimer that this does not constitute medical advice* Metabolism is defined as the whole range of biochemical processes that occur within a living organism and it constitutes the two processes of anabolism (build up) and catabolism (break down). In simpler terms, metabolism refers to the body’s complex process of energy expenditure or how our bodies convert calories into energy that enables us to function. So things such as: our digestive system, endocrine system, immune system, methylation track and in general every biological process that happens in our bodies is part of our metabolism. So, the term metabolism is referring to the overall chemical reactions that occur in an organism. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",385
Page 3,"The term metabolic rate is referring to the frequency of the metabolic pathways. So it refers to the amount of energy that is used by an organism to maintain life processes. On a cellular level, the health of mitochondria is what determines the health of one’s metabolism. Think of it this way: all the food we eat needs to be converted into energy that our body can use to keep on living. Mitochondria perform the first step in this extremely important process. Mitochondria are complex organelles that play a central role in energy metabolism, control of stress responses and are a hub for biosynthetic processes. Mitochondria have multiple functions within the cell that include ATP-production, calcium signaling, and apoptosis. So beyond their well established role in cellular energetics, mitochondria are critical mediators of signals to propagate various cellular outcomes. They are membrane-bound cell organelles that generate most of the chemical energy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions. Chemical energy produced by the mitochondria is stored in a small molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which the cell can use as an energy source. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",247
Page 4,"Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell so to speak since they produce approximately 90% of the ATP. Production of ATP requires 2 major steps. 1) Oxidation of NADH (NADH stands for ""nicotinamideadenine dinucleotide (NAD) + hydrogen (H)"") and 2)Phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP (oxidative phosphorylation [OXPHOS]). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",100
Page 5,"These 2 reactions are coupled in mitochondria, and OXPHOS is an efficient and energy-conserving way of producing energy in aerobic organisms. NADH or FADH2 are generated during glucose metabolism via glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle or β-oxidation of fatty acids. NADH or FADH2 are oxidized to NAD+ or FAD while protons are pumped to the intermitochondrial membrane through respiratory complexes I, III, and IV. The synthesis of ATP is done through the citric acid cyclewhich uses glucose, pyruvate and NADH as the input molecules. Before we talk about the citric acid cycle, we need to talk about glycolysis and pyruvate oxidationwhichis the step between glycolysisand the citric acid cycle. Glycolysisoccurs in the cytoplasm and is one methodthat cells use to produce energy in which glucose is partially broken down by cells in enzyme reactions that do not need oxygen and is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism. Note: Keep in mind that glycolysis provides less energy than oxidation provides a lot of the time. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",264
Page 6,"Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway (a linked series of chemical reactions occurring within a cell) that even bacteria and viruses have. For example, the medications and supplements that are safe and effective for fighting viruses such as aspirin (more about aspirin and how to properly use it later) affect how the viruses induce aerobic glycolysis and lactate production. Glycolysis is a series of reactions that extract energy from glucose by splitting it into two three-carbon molecules called pyruvates. The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy molecules adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). In anaerobic conditions pyruvate is converted to lactic acid and this is why even though glycolysis provides some usable energy, it provides less than oxidation provides. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",195
Page 7,"The chemical process in which oxygen is used to make energy from carbohydrates on the other hand is calledoxidative metabolismor aerobic metabolism. By inhibitingexcessiveglycolysis, through a varietyof means that we will see in this lesson, you dramatically improve oxidative metabolism and metabolic health as a result of this. This will be a key driver of cell differentiation and protect us against diseases like cancer since OXPHOS deficiency is a characteristic of all cancer cells. The mitochondria of cancer cells consume rather than produce ATP. The source of that ATP is most likely the upregulated glycolysis which is another hallmark of all cancer cells. So, in a sense, cancer cells have a very high rate of ""futile"" metabolism and they consume ATP in order to grow and multiply, instead of contributing to the healthy (OXPHOS) process of producing energy. For example, dichloroacetate is effective against a variety of cancers and it acts by reactivating the enzymes that oxidize pyruvic acid since the ability of the mitochondria to oxidize pyruvic acid (and glucose) is characteristically lostto some degreein cancer. OXPHOS, is also very very crucial for our brain health as well since it’s involved in neuronal development, connectivity, plasticity, and differentiation. Impairments in OXPHOS have been described in different general and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. A Major function of OXPHOS is to consume NADH and recycle NAD+ to reduce “reductive stress” and provide electron acceptors for aspartate synthesis. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",340
Page 8,"Thus OXPHOS defects will not only cause reduction in ATP production but also decrease the production of aspartate which is a limiting metabolite for cell proliferation. Mitochondria and the OXPHOS are not only responsible for production of high-energy phosphates, such as ATP and phosphocreatine, but are also involved in a variety of cellular processes, including calcium homeostasis, cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and apoptosis. Therefore, it is not surprising that multifaceted OXPHOS dysfunctions, originating from both genetic (maternal, or mendelian inheritance) and environmental influences, have been reported in many diseases and disorders, including neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder. (Pyruvic acid also has brain protective effects through its decarboxylation). Now let’s talk about pyruvic oxidation. Pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH) is the simplest of the alpha-ketoacids, with a carboxylic acid and a ketone functional group. The conjugate base, CH3COCOO−, is an intermediatein several metabolic pathways throughout the cell. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",280
Page 9,"Pyruvic acid can be made from glucose through glycolysis, converted back to carbohydrates (such as glucose) via gluconeogenesis, or to fatty acids through a reaction with acetyl-CoA. It can also be used to construct the amino acid alanine and can be converted into ethanol or lactic acid viafermentation. It supplies energy to cells through the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and alternatively ferments to produce lactate when oxygen is lacking. (*) Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that takes place in the cytosol of cells in all living organisms. In pyruvic oxidation, we are starting with a molecule of pyruvate which has 3 carbons. Then, we’ll make a molecule of acetyl by dropping a carbon and the carbon that is lost will be lost as a molecule of CO2. All of these carbon have high energy electrons in their orbitals. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",219
Page 10,"NAD will take the electron that became available through the above process for us to utilize and since it now has an electron on it, it becomes NADH. So NADH is the product and NAD the reactant. Now acetyl’s destination is the mitochondria. In order for this to happen, CoA will bind to acetyl and is going to produce acetyl-CoA which can now be accepted by the membrane of the mitochondria and now we can start the next step which is the citric acid cycle. So, pyruvic acid supplies energy to cells through the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and alternatively ferments to produce lactate when oxygen is lacking. A pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, will cause lactic acid to accumulate in the blood, it can damage the body's organs and particularly the nervous system. In aerobic conditions, the process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate (pyruvic acid), generating energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",238
Page 11,"Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced, but two are consumed as part of the preparatory phase. The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity (decrease its stability) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvate molecules by the enzyme aldolase. During the pay-off phase of glycolysis, four phosphate groups are transferred to ADP by substrate-level phosphorylation to make four ATP, and two NADH are produced when the pyruvate is oxidized. The overall reaction can be expressed this way: Glucose + 2 NAD++ 2 Pi+ 2 ADP → 2 pyruvate + 2 H++ 2 NADH + 2 ATP + 2 H+ + 2 H2O + energy ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",177
Page 12,"Starting with glucose, 1 ATP is used to donate a phosphate to glucose to produce glucose 6-phosphate. Glycogen can be converted into glucose 6-phosphate as well with the help of glycogen phosphorylase. During energy metabolism, glucose 6-phosphate becomes fructose 6-phosphate. An additional ATP is used to phosphorylate fructose 6-phosphate into fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by the help of phosphofructokinase. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate then splits into two phosphorylated molecules with three carbon chains which later degrades into pyruvate. Moving on to the citric acid cycle. The citric acid cycle (or else known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the Krebs’ cycle) is the major energy yielding metabolic pathway in cells, it is an important part of aerobic respiration and takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria (just like the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",228
Page 13,"In order for ATP to be produced through oxidative phosphorylation, electrons are required for ATP to pass down the electron transport chain. These electrons come from electron carriers such as NADH and FADH, which are produced by the citric acid cycle . The citric acid cycle harnesses the available chemical energy of acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) into the reducing power of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Here are some of the basic steps of the cycle. ●Step 1:The cycle begins with an enzymatic aldoladdition reaction of acetyl CoA to oxaloacetate, forming citrate which is isomerized by a dehydration-hydration sequence to yield (2R,3S)-isocitrate. ●Step 2: Citrate is converted to isocitrate . ●Step 3: Isocitrate is oxidized to alpha-ketoglutarate which results in the release of carbon dioxide. One NADH molecule is then formed. ●Step 4: Alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidized to form a 4 carbon molecule in order to bind to coenzyme A, forming succinyl CoA. A second molecule of NADH and CO2 are then being produced. ●Step 5: Succinyl CoA is then converted to succinate and one GTP molecule is produced. ●Step 6: Succinate is converted into fumarate and a molecule of FADH is produced. ●Step 7: Fumarate is converted to malate. ●Step 8: Malate is then converted into oxaloacetate. ●The third molecule of NADH is also produced. So, the products of the first turn of the cycle are one ATP, three NADH, one FADH2and two CO2. The total number of ATP molecules obtained after complete oxidation of one glucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation is estimated to be between 30 and 38. Note:Calcium is also used as a regulator in the citric acid cycle. Calcium levels in the mitochondrial matrix can reach up to the tens of micromolar levels during cellular activation. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",465
Page 14,"This short discussion about cellular respiration was done in order to introduce you to the concept of anti-metabolic and pro-metabolic compounds. Module 1.2: Anti-metabolic and pro-metabolic compounds Using our common sense we very quickly arrive to the realization that we need to know which compounds harm our metabolic health and which ones promote it, in order to avoid the first and include the second. Let’s start with theanti-metabolic compounds. Number 1: (Excessive) oxidative stress Oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage have been implicated in the pathogenesis of every metabolic disease. Oxidative stress is characterized by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can induce mitochondrial DNA mutations, damage the mitochondrial respiratory chain, alter membrane permeability, and influence Ca2+ homeostasis and mitochondrial defense systems. Calcium homeostasis refers to the maintenance of a constant concentration of calcium ions in the extracellular fluid. It includes all of the processes that contribute to maintaining calcium at its “set point.” ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",229
Page 15,"Because plasma [Ca2+] rapidly equilibrates with the extracellular fluid, ECF [Ca2+] is kept constant by keeping the plasma [Ca2+] constant. Maintaining a constant plasma [Ca2+] is important for things such as nerve transmission and conduction, cardigan contractility, blood clotting,cell to cell adhesionand of course bone formation. Now all the changes that were mentioned at the top of this page, are implicated in the development of metabolic diseases. A free radical attack occurs directly at complexes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mitochondria are normally protected from oxidative damage by a multilayer network of mitochondrial antioxidant systems which consist of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase together with a number of low molecular weight antioxidants such as α-tocopherol and ubiquinol. These molecules are particularly effective in scavenging lipid peroxyl radicals and preventing free radical chain reactions of lipid peroxidation. Cumulative oxidative injuries to mitochondria, triggered by endogenous metabolic processes and/or exogenous oxidative influences, cause mitochondria to progressively become less efficient. As mitochondria progressively lose their functional integrity, ever-greater proportions of oxygen molecules reaching them are converted to ROS. So the numerous and disparate mitochondrial functions include the synthesis of most of the ATP present in the cell, apoptosis, ion homeostasis, cellular stress response, antioxidant control, redox regulation, mitophagy and the involvement in various biosynthetic pathways. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",331
Page 16,"Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radical production and their detoxification. Free radicals are unstable compounds that lead to cell destruction and chronic inflammation. An atom or group of atoms with an unpaired electron is called a free radical. So a free radical can be defined as any molecular species capable of independent existence that contains an unpaired electron in an atomic orbital. A free radical is a molecule with an unpaired electron. It can steal electrons from a stable molecule, creating a new free radical and initiating a chain reaction. This electron-grabbing is called o x i d a t i o nand canset up a chain reaction, creating new free radicals and damaging important molecules along the way, similar to how one falling domino can bring down countless more. Antioxidants are molecules that can donate an electron to stabilize and neutralize free radicals. An antioxidant can stop the free radical chain reaction in its tracks by donating an electron and then the antioxidant itself becomes a free radical. Byt antioxidants are not very reactive themselves and have processes for quick stabilization. Free radicals are a natural byproduct of metabolic reactions and of exercise, and it’s normal to have low levels of free radicals in the body. With enough antioxidants present, free radicals can be kept in check so that they aren’t dangerous. However,too many free radicals and not enough protectionfrom antioxidants creates a situation called oxidative stress. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",300
Page 17,"Free radical development is unavoidable, but human bodies have adapted by setting up and maintaining defense mechanisms that reduce their impact. The body’s two major defense systems are free radical detoxifying enzymes and antioxidants. Free radical detoxifying enzyme systems are responsible for protecting the insides of cells from free radical damage. An antioxidant is any molecule that can block free radicals from stealing electrons. antioxidants act both inside and outside of cells. The three major enzyme systems and the chemical reactions they catalyze are: 1.Superoxide Dismutases (SOD). They are essential forfree radical detoxification and these enzymes either have manganese, copper or zinc as a cofactor. 2.Catalase.These enzymes convert hydrogen peroxideto water and oxygen and finish the detoxification process that SOD starts. This enzyme contains iron as a cofactor but since iron can be tricky, don’t simply start upping the high iron foods in order to boost catalase enzymes. 3.Glutathione Peroxidases.These selenium dependentenzymes also convert hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. Antioxidants are broadly classified as either hydrophilic (water soluble) or hydrophobic (lipid soluble), and this classification determines where they act in the body. Hydrophilic antioxidants act in the cytosol of cells or in extracellular fluids such as blood, hydrophobic antioxidants are largely responsible for protecting cell membranes from free radical damage. The body can synthesize some antioxidants, but others must be obtained from the diet. There are two antioxidants that the body synthesizes. 1) Glutathione, which contains a sulfur group thatcan donate an electron to a free radical, thereby stabilizing it. 2) Uric acidwhich is too high of a concentrationcan cause gout. There are many different antioxidants in food as well. Antioxidant vitamins(Vitamin E, Vitamin C) donatetheir electrons to free radicals to stabilize them. Antioxidant phytochemicals(beta-carotene and othercarotenoids) may inhibit the oxidation of lipids or donate electrons. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",447
Page 18,"Antioxidant mineralsact as cofactors within complex antioxidant enzyme systems (superoxide dismutases, catalase, glutathione peroxidases described earlier) to convert free radicals to less damaging substances that can be excreted. Vitamin E Sources:EVOO, red palm oil, low dose (20mg) of supplementalvitamin E coming from red palm oil (doses higher than 20mg of vitamin E will deplete other fat soluble vitamins very fast) and palm kernel oil. Functions:Protects cellular membranes and preventsglutathione depletion. When we talk about vitamin E, we’re actually referring to 8 chemically similar substances, of whichalpha-tocopherol appears to bethe most potent antioxidants. Because vitamin E is fat-soluble, its antioxidant capacity is especially important to lipids, including those in cell membranes and lipoproteins. For example, free radicals can oxidize LDL cholesterol (stealing an electron from it), and it is this damaged LDL that lodges in blood vessels and forms the fatty plaques characteristic of atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other complications of cardiovascular disease. After alpha-tocopherol interacts with a free radical it is no longer capable of acting as an antioxidant unless it is enzymatically regenerated. Vitamin E, mainly as alpha-tocopherol, plays a role in the immune system, regulation of gene expression, and cell signaling. It also enhances the dilation of blood vessels and inhibits blood clot formation. Vitamin E can be destroyed at high temperatures,sothings such as sunflower and soybean oil are of course not a good vitamin E source. Vitamin C Sources:Berries (preferably wild berries), camu camu,acerola cherries, kiwis, grapefruit juice with no pulp and orange juice with no pulp. These foods should not be paired with foods high in iron since this increases oxidative stress (more about unbound iron later). Function:Protects DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids andaids in regenerating vitamin E. Vitamin C, is a water-soluble vitamin essential in the diet for humans. Interestingly, most other mammals can readily synthesize vitamin C and don’t require it in their diets. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",478
Page 19,"Vitamin C’s ability to easily donate electrons makes it a highly effective antioxidant. Since it is water-soluble, it acts both inside and outside cells to protect molecules in aqueous environments. Vitamin C also plays a vital role in regenerating vitamin E after it has acted as an antioxidant, allowing it to be recycled and used again. After vitamin E donates an electron to neutralize a free radical, it can be regenerated by an electron from vitamin C. Vitamin C is then regenerated by antioxidant enzymes. In addition to its role as an antioxidant, vitamin C is a required part of several enzymes involved in the synthesis of c o l l a g e n, a proteinimportant to the strength and structure of muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments, connective tissue, and skin. Selenium Sources:Shellfish, organs, eggs Function:Cofactor of free radical detoxifying enzymes,maintains glutathione levels, aids in regeneration of vitamins C and E. Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is part of the structure of at least 25 proteins in the body with functions in thyroid hormone metabolism, DNA synthesis, reproduction and protecting the immune system. As part of antioxidant enzymes, selenium helps to regenerate other antioxidants, including vitamin C. These enzymes also protect lipids from free radicals, and, in doing so, spare vitamin E. This also illustrates how antioxidants work together to protect the body against free radical-induced damage. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",312
Page 20,"And last but not least, we have:carotenoidsfrom sources such as pumpkin, squash, peaches, apricots and carrot juice which function as free radical scavengers. Electrons can act as powerful antioxidants as well. A very effective and free tool that will greatly reduce oxidative stress is grounding or as often is referred to as “earthing”. The earth contains an endless supply of electrons which can be used in order to neutralize free radicals in the body. Connecting our bodies to the earth (especially during sleep with means such as grounding sheets (sounds crazy but it works) normalizes the daily cortisol rhythm, improves sleep, leads to reductions in pain, inflammation and increases the metabolic rate. This happens since the surface of the earth possesses a limitless and continuously renewed supply of free or mobile electrons as a consequence of a global atmospheric electric circuit. A direct earth connection enables both diurnal electrical rhythms are free electrons to flow from the earth to the body and neutralize the positively charged free radicals that are the hallmark of chronic inflammation as we just saw. So free electrons from the earth can resolve chronic inflammation by serving as natural antioxidants. Again, free radicals are not evil in a binary manner. Free radicals to a degree are needed for optimal health when derived from normal essential metabolic processes in the human body. For example, the immune system uses the cell-damaging properties of free radicals to kill pathogens. First, immune cells engulf an invader, then they expose it to free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide, which destroys its membrane and the invader is thus neutralized. Free radicals are necessary for many other bodily functions as well. The body creates free radicals through the normal processes of metabolism (i.e., turning food into usable energy/ATP). When the amount of free radicals exceeds the body’s ability to eliminate or neutralize them, an oxidative imbalance results. Substances and energy sources from the environment can add to or accelerate the production of free radicals within the body. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",420
Page 21,"Excessive exposure to environmental sources of free radicals is what contributes to diseaseby overwhelming the free radicaldetoxifying systems and those processes involved in repairing oxidative damage. So the problem starts when ROS are derived from external sources such as smoking, nnEMF, heavy metals, stress, air pollutants, X-Rays, bad food choices and so on. Free radical formation occurs continuously in the cells as a consequence of both enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions. Bullet points on how to battle oxidative stress effectively. Number 1:Providing components such as selenium,vitamin C, beta carotene, vitamin E and sulfur in balanced quantities to our body through our diet. Number 2:Not neglecting the fat soluble vitaminsA and K which are critical for our bodies to be able to utilize the above dietary antioxidants better but they also have some antioxidant properties on their own. Number 3:Grounding as much as possible during theday and avoid unnecessary sources of nnEMF. Number 4:Restoring the mineral balance (see heavymetal detox). Number 5:Detoxing from heavy metals (see heavy metaldetox). Number 6:Support glutathione. Glutathione is made mainly from three amino acids: glycine, cysteine, and glutamine, and has the major function of protecting the mitochondria against oxidative stress. In order to boost glutathione production: 1)Consume sulfur rich foodssuch as fish, beef, onions,garlic, shallots and organic broccoli once in a while after you’ve healed your gut. 2)Consume vitamin C and E rich foods.Vitamin C maintainsthe body’s supply of antioxidants, including glutathione and helps reprocess glutathione by converting oxidized glutathione back to its active form. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",386
Page 22,"3)Consume selenium rich foods.Selenium is a glutathione cofactor, meaning it’s a substance needed for glutathione activity and will lead to increased glutathione peroxidase levels. 4)Start adding turmeric in your meals once in a while.Numerous animal and test-tube studies have shown that turmeric and curcumin extract have the ability to increase glutathione levels. Just make sure to add some black pepper to turmeric to help the absorption. 5)Consume the rest of the important nutrients that our body needs to make and recycle glutathione which are:magnesium, zinc,B vitamins, glycine and glutamine which can all be found in animal products such as organs, oysters, free range eggs and bone marrow. Note: Short term glycine supplementation post workoutcan also help boost glutathione. Number 7:Tools to use under sickness (extreme inflammatorystates) and under over exposure to environmental pollutants (if for example you live in a huge city). Tool 1:NAC taken with a meal that has a small amount(20-30 grams) of beef liver since NAC can deplete you of copper fast, but also bi weekly oysters instead of weekly, since it can also deplete you of zinc. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",279
Page 23,"NAC should be used as a short term toll with the main uses of: brain support, lung support, liver support, kidney support, glutathione support and reducing cortisol. Tool 2:Cacao. Cacao has even up to 50 times more antioxidant capacity than berries if it’s organic. It’s a great source of magnesium but it should be avoided to be consumed on a daily basis due to its high oxalate content. If you don’t have any kidney issues, mixing organic cacao with some grass fed or raw goat’s butter and unheated/raw honey to turn it into a paste and throw it on top of fruit, can be a great pre/post workout snack that will also boost your performance. Number 8:Boost CO2 as will be demonstrated in a fewpages. Also, factors likestresscan put pressure on theantioxidant system by generating higher levels of free radicals so try to avoid stress as well if possible by not overworking yourself, overexercising or doing extreme diets. So far, we briefly talked about mitochondria, how the dysregulation of the antioxidant response leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and what we can do about it. When the rate of ROS production exceeds cellular antioxidant capacity, the ensuing oxidative stress damages vital components of the cell, resulting in oxidation of membranes, proteins, and nucleic acids. Thus, ROS can potentiate damage to mitochondrial energy production by causing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and subsequent defects in mtDNA-encoded subunits of the respiratory complex I and III. Last but certainly not least, carbon dioxide has great antioxidant effects as well, so implementing what you are about to read in the next parts of this lesson will greatly help you as well and do wonders for your health. In the next part of this lesson, we will talk about sleep and how to optimize it. Number 2: Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) PUFAs harm the ability of the cells to use glucose by blocking the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme that is essential for the use of glucose .

ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",441
Page 32,"Step4:Addressexcessiveserotoninsinceserotoniniscloselyrelatedto estrogen by using what will be demonstrated in the next module. Step 5:Use some safe anti estrogenic compounds suchas saturated fats from coconut oil, cocoa butter, grass fed tallow and so on, glycine, magnesium, taurine, B vitamins (start with ⅓ of the recommended dose when it comes to any supplement and do not use supplements with bad additives such as silicon, cornstarch, artificial sweeteners and so on). Step 6:Optimize gut health (as demonstrated laterin this lesson). Step 7:After making sure that you have enough vitaminA (retinol), magnesium, zinc and K2 in your system, short term pregnenolone, DHEA and progesterone (only natural progesterone and only diluted in vitamin E) can also be beneficial. Do not supplement all 3 simultaneously. Start with pregnenolone. More about these hormones as well as how to properly use them will be discussed in various parts of this program. Step 8:Use the binder salad (more details will begiven in the next module, but this salad is basically made of peeled and chopped carrots, avocados, a little blackseed oil, a little coconut oil, a little ginger, 30 grams of beef liver and sea salt). Step 9:And of course last but not least, optimizeandrogens as it will be demonstrated in lesson 2. Lowering stress, optimizing thyroid performance and addressing unbound iron, will also be very beneficial and are addressed in lesson 1. Number 7:Stress hormones Stress has been known to cause breakage of the nuclear chromosomes and damage mitochondrial genes. Stress will directly suppress our metabolism, severely lower testosterone, cause hair loss, increase serotonin, estrogen, prolactin and damage our gut. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",391
Page 33,"Stress will of course raise cortisol and adrenaline which lead to excessive metabolism of protective hormones such as progesterone through (partly) the progesterone steal. Stress inevitably leads to a deficiency of all of the steroid protective hormones. Stress and ROS are very connected so when you find yourself under situations of extreme stress it will be very useful to re-read that part. Avoiding alcohol, getting plenty of sleep, not fasting extensively (daily fasting for more than 12-14 hours), plenty of grounding, optimizing GABA as it will be demonstrated on the next module, minimizing exposure to nnEMF, balancing the amino acid profile of one’s diet as will be demonstrated in lesson2, not following extreme diets and making sure that one does not over-exercise(*) in order to not trigger the production of too much lactic acid (if you live your workouts burn out, you overdid it), making sure that you get enough magnesium, bioavailable protein, zinc and glycine will all be crucial in order to restore metabolic health by lowering stress hormones. Glycine modulates the cytokines that are involved in many inflammatory diseases and will also help you manage NO production. (*)The fatigue produced by over training is produced by a tryptophan and serotonin overload both of which are anti-metabolic.It’s better to break your workouts into more sessions with less volume, than it is to burn yourself out. Number 8:(Excessive) lactic acid Lactic acid reduces oxidative production of energy (it inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase) and is involved in the degradation of mitochondria. In fact, lactic acid can be so anti-metabolic that it can be considered as one of the main drivers of cancer since high lactate generation is commonly seen in cancer cells and tumors. Lactic acid also has opposite effects to the protective CO2 and lactic acid buildup can even trigger seizures, heart failure (excessive lactic acid ages the heart and ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",417
Page 34,"this is one reason why athletes experience heart problems (anabolic steroids such as HGH being another one)) it leads to calcified tissues and of course harm the liver and kidneys as well. Plan of action. Step 1:Increase CO2 as will be demonstrated in thenext module since increasing C02 limits the formation of lactic acid due to its opposing effects. Step 2:Use a meal of seasonal fruit, bioavailableprotein, thiamine and coconut oil as a pre workout meal and coconut water or sparkling water that isnaturally carbonated intra workout. This meal is extremely effective for preventing lactic acid build up and improving your performance. You will notice the benefits from the first session (do not skip the coconut oil). Thiamine prevents lactic acid build up (*) and coconut oil contains palmitic acid which activates a respiratory enzyme which suppresses the formation of lactic acid. (*) Taking thiamine is a treatment for lactic acidosis but also generally helps to reduce lactic acid production when the individual is under stress and promotes normal cellular respiration Step 3:Optimize thyroid performance (full protocolin this lesson). Step 4:Short term biotin supplementation. Excess lactic acid can be “treated” by poisoning glycolysis by using dichloroacetic acid and increasing the oxidation of glucose. Well, things such as thiamine, biotin and thyroid, increase the oxidation of glucose as well but way more safer and more effectively. This is why a B vitamin deficiency is directly linked to lactic acidosis. Step 5:No fermented foods(this includes beer). Some beers purposely contain lactic acid such as the Belgianlambics. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",356
Page 35,"Bacterial lactic acid is way more toxic than the type that we form under conditions such as training. So avoid foods such as kimchi/sauerkraut, yogurt and sourdough. Step 6:After making sure than you have enough antioxidantsin your system (how to properly do this in the rules for safe sun exposure (same lesson)), get sunlight at least 3 times a day. Once a little after sunrise, once midday and once a little before sunset. Number 9:Tryptophan , cysteine and an unbalancedamino acid profile Everything else that we have discussed so far (even the concept that serotonin is something bad when in excess and someone actually needs a very small amount of it in order for his intestines to be healthy, but also, that estrogen is a stress hormone and progesterone is the actual female hormone), can be linked back to various researchers and people like Otto,KatherinaDaltonandSzent-Gyorgyi. But when it comes to the concept of balancing amino acids, we need to give credits to Ray. Ray pointed out (or at least popularized) that tryptophan and cysteine inhibit thyroid function, mitochondrial energy production and decrease one’s ability to withstand stress partly as a result of that. Ray has contributed of course to the understanding of many pro-metabolic and anti-metabolic concepts as well and his work is very valuable if one can interpret it right. In fact, i can even say that the first lesson might even be such an attempt by also combining the works of other great people and some recent studies. Studying Ray will not provide you with a prescription like solution but he’s a great guy and you should check his work if you have the time. One reason why the amino acid tryptophan can be considered as anti-metabolic, is because it is the precursor to serotonin. When serotonin is concentrated in high doses, it causes severe inflammation which can lead to immunosuppression and neurological damage. Ray points out that restricting only tryptophan or only cysteine produces a greater extension of the life span than achieved in most of the studies of caloric restriction and if you go down that rabbit it checks out. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",473
Page 36,"Why could this be the case? Well, one of the reasons why it’s probably because they throw the methionine:glycine ratio out of balance which can have many negative effects such as even depleting someone of copper. This is why for example a lot of people’s premature white hair improve after starting balancing the amino acid profile in their diets, it is because the depletion of copper is one of the causes of premature white hair and balancing the amino acids can prevent this to some extent. Our bodies got adapted into getting every amino acid that an animal has to offer since we could not afford wasting any part of it. But in today’s society that we tend to eat too much muscle meat and little to none organ meats, bone marrow and the rest of the animal parts, the amino acid profile of our diets is nothing but balanced and when something gets out of balance in the human body health problems will rise sooner or later. The average person literally consumes zero grams of glycine every day when we need anywhere from 10-60 grams depending on our age and other things such as copper status, electrolyte status and so on. This, first of all, harms our liver. Glycine is in fact a non essential amino acid which means that our body can create some glycine. But when the demands of glycine skyrocket due to the methionine ratio in our diets, the liver has to overwork in order to provide enough glycine. This is also a severely under-rated factor why stuttering in young kids is so common nowadays. A severe imbalance between methionine and glycine, puts the sympathetic nervous system on override and harms one’s nervous system in general as well. (Every concept that is mentioned here, it doesn't matter if it’s glycine or stuttering, gets discussed in more detail in various parts of the program). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",397
Page 37,"Most people that have never consumed things such as bone marrow, bone broth, (quality) gelatin or have not supplement with glycine or things such as magnesium glycinate, will benefit from incorporating some magnesium glycinate, bone marrow and bone broth coming from quality animals or if you want to be more precise, for every 100-150 grams of non collagen animal protein (muscle meats), consumed 10 grams of 10 grams of (quality) collagen. A lot of people are also deficient in folate (don’t simply go and buy a bottle of folic acid), so excessive consumption of methionine will lead to elevated blood levels of homocysteine which have been associated with several chronic conditions. If you really want to know the exact ratios of amino acids that are in your system(*) , the best thing to do is ask your doctor for a plasma amino acids test but these can be very expensive and almost never covered by insurance. (*)Again, if you have never eaten things such as bone marrow, bone broth, gelatin or have been supplemented with any form of glycine, it is very unlikely that they are. Now let’s talk about thepro-metaboliccompounds. Number 1:Thyroid The thyroid gland is so important for our metabolic health that there is an entire part in this lesson which will make you understand its function, which things you should test for and how to optimize the function of your thyroid. Optimizing thyroid performance is also one of the most undervalued but extremely effective ways of optimizing testosterone, DHT and lowering estrogen as well since thyroid upregulates all steroidogenic enzymes. We can not have optimal metabolic health without a healthy thyroid. Number 2:Sunlight Simply by paying attention to nature and seeing that everything starts to flourish in spring and die in autumn, should give us a hint of how sunlight supports life and its expansion. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",393
Page 38,"But nowadays people are told to avoid the sun. They are told to avoid the thing that gives life to everything on this planet, the thing that regulates our circadian rhythm and so every metabolic process, the thing that can double their testosterone levels and significantly improve insulin resistance (in modern environments if one is not getting any sunlight, the overexposure to blue light is enough to cause problems with glucose metabolism), researchers completely ignore a lot of the time that there are light-sensitive protein on fat cells, that a lack of sunlight suppresses thyroid hormone productions (and thus harms our metabolic health like very few things) and progesterone, they ignore that most people are deficient in precious vitamin D which is also critical for our hormonal health and in general there is a lot of propaganda that is going on against the sun. It is in fact true that since our skin is made out of the things that we eat, if a person’s diet consists of pro-inflammatory fats like vegetable oils, it ignores the hormetic effect of the sun (one must gradually build up to the amount that he exposes his skin to sunlight) and is contributing to the excess creation of ROS by drinking alcohol on a regular basis, smoking and never grounding, he can of course encounter skin cancer. But the sun by itself does not cause cancer and without daily exposure to even natural light we can’t have a healthy metabolism. Note:Every topic that is discussed in the first 50pages, is an attempt to ease the individual into certain ideas that will be discussed in more detail in other various parts of the program. So a lot of questions that might be created while reading this material are indeed addressed later. Number 3:B vitamins Don’t forget that B vitamins are essential in the citric acid cycle. 1) Thiamine (B1) is essential for TPP. 2) Riboflavin (B2) is essential for FAD. 3) Niacin (B3) is essential for NAD. 4) Pantothenic acid is essential for CoA. The following graph demonstrates how each one of the B vitamins impacts energy production. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",444
Page 39,"In any metabolic disease, it does not matter if it’s cancer or T2D, the ability of mitochondria to oxidize sugar is lost to a degree. B vitamins are water soluble vitamins that most people are deficient in nowadays (both due to a lack of them in their diet, their depletion though means such as alcohol but also due to environmental factors such as stress) but they are necessary for glucose metabolism. B vitamins such as B3 also support glucose metabolism by lowering free fatty acid and further supporting sugar oxidation. How to properly restore B vitamins is properly addressed on the part of optimizing glucose metabolism. Number 4:Progesterone Progesterone is a hormone that has many important effects on carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism but also protects many vital organs and tissue. Progesterone is the actual female hormone and not estrogen. For example, estrogen can cause miscarriages while progesterone can greatly prevent them. We all have progesterone receptors so this hormone is not only important for women, in fact, a great part of testosterone is derived from progesterone. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",233
Page 40,"We have many progesterone receptors in our brain(*), lungs, liver, bones, skin, hair follicles, lungs and in case you are a woman, in the uterus. (*) There are progesterone receptors in the limbic area of the brain, which is responsible for behavior and emotional responses. This is why a progesterone deficiency which is very common in modern society since a lot of women regularly consume estrogenic substances such as birth control pills, has catastrophic effects on the mood of women. Progesterone also increases the synthesis of ceruloplasminwhich is the major copper-carrying protein in the blood and in addition plays a role in iron metabolism. As we will see, unbound iron is a major contributor to many diseases and the reason that people still suffer from problems which spring from unbound iron is a progesterone deficiency. Progesterone also has many anti-estrogenic effects all the way to even restoring one’s fertility, can prevent seizures, decalcify the tissues, improve hypothyroidism and lower PTH pretty fast since it redirects calcium where it is needed the most. Now how you can boost progesterone. First, make sure that you get enough sunlight multiple times a day since a lack of sunlight will directly suppress progesterone. If it’s usually cloudy where you live, obviously still go outside since you need natural light in order to set your circadian rhythm and many biological processes and you can also use a right light device if you can afford it. Then, vitamin A and saturated fats such as coconut oil are essential in order for cholesterol to be converted to progesterone so the second step that you can do in order to make sure that the endogenous production of progesterone in not harmed, is eating some beef liver cooked on coconut oil once or twice a week depending on the dose (for the average person, 200-300 (tops) grams of beef liver per week are enough since vitamin A toxicity can be a real things under certain conditions (for example an improper methionine:glycine ratio will greatly impact vitamin A toxicity)). When it comes to supplementing progesterone, typically, it is safer to start with pregnenolone first especially if you are a man. In order to safely supplement both there are 2 critical prerequisites. 1)Make sure that you have enough vitamin A (retinol) in your system. This means that in case organ meats were not a part of your diet, you need to focus on ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",529
Page 41,"consuming them (do not over do it) for 3-5 weeks before supplementing any of these. 2) Make sure that you have enough calcium, its regulators (magnesium, vitamin D and vitamin K for the most part) and zinc in your system by following any diet plan that will be recommended in this program for 3-5 weeks. Then and only then you can try pregnenolone or progesterone (only use natural progesterone) in very small doses (always start with less of what a supplement or medication recommends). Both need to be cycles and dizziness is a sign that you overdid it. If you get dizzy/nauseated with even the smallest dose, you have enough in your system. Number 5:Carbohydrates Carbohydrates are organic compounds that consist of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen andare pro metabolic. There are three main types of carbohydrates: 1)Starches 2)Fiber 3)Sugars We mostly like fructose, some specific types of fiber and very very few types of starch since they are the most pro metabolic. Carbohydrates also produce more CO2 than protein and fats and will be discussed in more detail in lesson 2 with the other macronutrients, but vitamins and minerals as well. So carbohydrates are pro-metabolic, however,whenwe increase metabolic activity, we can exacerbate a nutritional and hormonal deficiencyand this is why so many people today are “carb intolerant”. They are not carb intolerant, they are malnourished. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",326
Page 42,"You can’t increase the metabolic activity and not experience side effects in case you are nutrient depleted. Replenish the nutrients first as you will see in this program and reintroduce the right type of carbs as it will be demonstrated. Number 5:Saturated fats Compounds such as stearic acid that can be found in saturated fats, promote mitochondrial fusion (mitochondrial fusion is necessary for cell survival and for the movement of mitochondria within neurons). In modern society where PUFAs are so abundant, things such as coconut oil, grass fed tallow, ghee and butter (after you have addressed certain conditions), cocoa butter, raw goat’s milk and things of this nature are all critical components of a robust metabolic health. Not to mention that saturated fats have anti-serotonin and antihistamine effects. Number 6: Blackseed oil Not all seed oils are created equal, blackseed oil recycles NADH back to NAD+ and can thus help correct the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway which we will mention in the module of glucose optimization. When shopping for blackseed oil, make sure that it is cold pressed but that also it does not include additives such as canola, sunflower, soybean and in general inferior fats. Number 7:CO2 Carbon dioxide can even directly help our body generate mitochondria (and stabilize them) so pay special attention to what you’re about to read in the next module. Number 8:Taurine Taurine has been used for years to treat cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer disease, cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, muscular degradation, hepatic disorders and in general prevent chronic inflammation in adipose tissue. Taurine also greatly supports glucose metabolism and if one’s metabolism is not at the condition that he would like, along with B vitamins, taurine can greatly help with restoring sugar oxidation. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",397
Page 43,"Taurine regulates the expression of insulin receptor IRS1 and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) which are involved in the insulin signaling pathway and glucose metabolism but it also regulates glucagon, and somatostatin. From successfully reducing triglycerides and unbound iron all the way to preventing obesity, taurine is a great overall supplement. In the case that someone breaks out (not in hives, small pimples) or he smells funny after taking thiamine or taurine, this is a sign of excess unbound iron (unbound iron is so dangerous that it is excreted through the skin in order to not damage the organs) and needs to be immediately addressed as demonstrated on the part of heavy metal detox. Taurine is so pro-metabolic that it greatly reduces LDL cholesterol as well without any of the negative effects that other cholesterol lowering substances can have such as beta glucan (beta glucan lowers testosterone and DHT). Number 9:Vitamin C Vitamin C is crucial for the health of our endocrine system especially when someone is under stress. It carries out redox reactions, is crucial for iron homeostasis, immune system and heart health, is linked to the metabolism of glutathione and very few studies show that it can help restore OXPHOS. More about vitamin C later in this lesson and in lesson 2. For now, keep in mind that adding foods in your diet such as berries, acerola cherry and camu camu could be a good idea for most people especially if you are living somewhere sunny and are or used to be a smoker. Number 10:Fat soluble vitamins and CoQ10. These are the molecules besides the ones mentioned that can restore OXPHOS very efficiently. We already briefly talked about the importance of vitamin E and A for our metabolic health. When it comes to vitamin K, it will greatly improve our gut health and our metabolic health as a result of that since endotoxins(*) are a source for disrupted oxidative metabolism. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",423
Page 44,"(*)Endotoxins are toxins located inside of bacteria and when released, they interfere with mitochondrial respiration, thyroid function, raise estrogen, nitric oxide, serotonin and lactic acid (well, lactate to be precise). Stress, working out fasted and constipation cause increased endotoxin leakage from the gut and absorption to the blood. When it comes to CoQ10 you might have heard about its heart protective effects but CoQ10 is an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain as well (this is why it probably is one of the most undervalued lipid soluble antioxidants as well) but also plays a key role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. CoQ10 is also involved in the regeneration of the antioxidants vitamin C and E besides being a mediator of inflammation in general and plays a role in cholesterol metabolism so a CoQ10 deficiency negatively affects steroidogenesis. This is one of the reasons why statins (cholesterol lowering drugs) can drop testosterone levels so fast (statins deplete CoQ10). CoQ10 has been shown to also significantly reduce HbA1c levels in type II diabetics. Number 11:Glycine We briefly discussed glycine when discussing balancing amino acids. Glycine is an amazing and crucial amino acid (unless you are struggling with a bacterial overgrowth in which in most cases you need to stay away from its supplemental form for a while and stick to things such as bone marrow and perhaps grass fed collagen) that has many benefits. Glycine protects our nervous system, lowers cytokines, NO, estrogen, mitigates excessive serotonin and inhibits lipolysis. Number 12:Methylene blue Methylene blue increases NAD/NADH ratio (one of the reasons why it was used to treat schizophrenia), increases the number of mitochondria, is a great antioxidant, it stimulates glucose metabolism and increases oxygen in brain cells. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",398
Page 45,"Methylene blue is a great metabolic enhancer but it obviously needs to be cycled since it can increase acetylcholine too much after a certain point and cause severe anxiety. But in general, it is a great short term tool in order to restore OXPHOS if one has the common sense to use a low dose, cycle it, use pharmacological grade and replenish B vitamins first. Number 13:Aspirin Aspirin stimulates mitochondrial respiration, can promote normal cell division, activates glycolysis, increases CO2 and has anti-estrogenic effects. Disclaimer: Aspirin is a very tricky substance in the modern day and age because: a) a lot of people have taken medication such as accutane which overload the pancreas and if they consume aspirin a lot of negative side effects can be expected, b) the additives that aspirin contains have changed the last years and c)most people are deficient in vitamin K (both K1 and K2). So in order for someone to use aspirin he must first of all, replenish vitamin K (see lesson 2), dilute the aspirin in water in order for the additives to sit at the bottom of the glass and only the salicylic acid to be consumed and of course, focus on optimizing his gut health as will be demonstrated on this lesson first. Module 1.3: Optimize sleep Deep sleep helps the body generate more mitochondria and triggers the multiplication of stem cells. This is one of the reasons why lack of sleep damages our health very fast. Getting quality sleep on a daily basis is non negotiable for anyone who wants to optimize his metabolic health. Any form of sleep disorder will cause metabolic harm and severely lower androgens. You can easily increase your testosterone for up to 200 ng/dL if you just optimize sleep. Besides this, routinely sleeping less than six hours doubles our risk for encountering cancer, which says a lot about the way sleep affects our metabolism (cancer is a metabolic disease). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",419
Page 46,"Inadequate sleep, even moderate reductions for just one week, disrupts blood sugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic. HRR analysis showed that sleep deprivation affected mitochondrial bioenergetics capacity, decreasing respiration at oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and electron transport system (ETS). In addition, the expression of genes involved in the response to oxidative stress and apoptosis were increased. Sleep is intricately connected to various hormonal and metabolic processes in the body and is important in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Many research has shown that sleep deprivation and sleep disorders have profound anti metabolic effects and a single night of insomnia is enough to short term decrease the metabolic rate by 25%. Sleep deprivation causes a lot of serious problems with the most common ones being: -Depression -Fatigue -Immune system dysfunction -Myocardial Infarct -Stroke -Insulin resistance -Vascular disease -Hypertension -Psychosis -Diabetes -Mood disorders -Obesity -Panic disorders -Anxiety -Neurological damage -Skin aging -Dark circles ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",237
Page 47,"-Vision problems -Estrogen dominance -Hypogonadism -Hair loss -Skin issues If you encounter any of the above, ask yourselves if your sleep is in optimal condition. If someone told you that he invented a pill that can help you prevent all of the above and makes you 3 times more productive, you would pay good money for it. Yet sleep is something completely free with the ability to transform your health and every aspect of your life. It is more effective than any antidepressant, any diabetes medication, any nootropic, any anabolic steroid, any anti-aging cream or procedure, any fat loss people, any testosterone booster and any gut healing supplement since even short term insomnia by itself can cause a leaky gut. So before grabbing that bone broth or kimchi for improving your gut health (which is something counterproductive actually for a lot of people and we will see why) make sure to optimize your sleep. Optimizing sleep is the most effective jack of all trades when it comes to improving any aspect of our physical and mental well being. If you don’t know what’s the first step in order to optimize every aspect of your health, this is it. If you think that you are sleeping fine ask yourselves the following 3 questions: 1)Can i sleep every night for 8 hours straight with no problem? ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",284
Page 48,"2)Do i have dreamless sleep? (Yes, dreamless) 3)Do i wake up rejuvenated every morning? If the answer to any of this is no, then there’s room for improvement and these are good news because it means that you can massively improve your health completely for free. Now sleep is controlled by two processes: circadian and homeostatic. During waking hours, the sleep drive gradually increases until it reaches a critical threshold. This drive is referred to as homeostatic. Circadian rhythm, on the other hand, is a signal generated by the master clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) located in the anterior hypothalamus. Circadian rhythm, derived from the Latin term“circadiem”which literally means “approximately one day” is the body's internal clock. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",185
Page 49,"This clock is set at slightly over 24 hours. It controls sleep as well as most biological processes, including hormone production, metabolism, core body temperature variations, and cell regeneration among others. This clock is normally highly synchronized to environmental cues (Zeitgebers, German for “time giver”), the strongest of them being the light-dark cycle. In most humans the alertness pattern shows a biphasic distribution, with a mid-day decrease in alertness around 2–4 pm, followed by an increased alertness during mid to late evening, and finally declining to its lowest levels during the night. Disturbance of this well-regulated circadian rhythm and homeostatic drive (circadian misalignment) can lead to various sleep disorders collectively known as circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Shift work disorder is one of the circadian rhythm disorders which have been a focus of large epidemiological studies for its potential implications on health. A Swedish study followed shift workers for 15 years and reported increased relative risk for ischemic heart disease (RR = 2.8) as compared to daytime workers independent of smoking and age with similar socioeconomic background. More recent studies have suggested that shift work is the most significant source of ischemic heart disease accounting for over 10% of mortality in men and over 5% in women. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",278
Page 50,"In a large cohort of subjects followed prospectively in the Nurse Health Study II investigators found increased risk of type II diabetes in young and middle age nurses working in rotating night shift work. Cross-sectional data also suggests higher triglyceride levels, lower HDL levels, and more obesity in the shift workers than daytime workers. Circadian misalignment suggests its role, albeit unclear, in metabolic dysregulation. Since sleep deprivation is commonly associated with shift work disorder further prospective trials adjusting for sleep deprivation are required to establish the role of circadian misalignment as opposed to the indirect effect of sleep deprivation on metabolic dysregulation. So, a lot of people today experience sleep problems and the problem is usually a dysregulated CR (circadian rhythm). This is one of the reasons why despite the fact that tips about sleep can help some people sleep, it usually does not help them get deep restful sleep because they don’t address the circadian rhythm. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",200
Page 51,"So let’s see how to optimize it with the 12 steps i’ve shared with clients over the years. I myself had chronic insomnia (could not sleep for more than 4 hours for years) and this is how I fixed it. I suggest you focus on truly optimizing your sleep for one week straight before moving to anything else. How to fix circadian rhythm dysregulation in 2-12 weeks Step 1:Wake up between 6 and 8 A.M if you can. Step 2:Do not look at any artificial light as soonas you wake up, have a glass of filtered water, a pinch of sea salt and either go for a walk around the block, or do some breathing exercises from your balcony. If you can, sun gaze for a few seconds as well. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",172
Page 52,"Step 3:Eat something that includes animal protein,salt, fruit and some saturated fats. You will see a lot of breakfast ideas soon. Eating breakfast is crucial. I can not tell you how many clients had severe insomnia simply because they skipped breakfast and had black coffee instead. A combination popularized by the fitness industry which has led to thousands of people suffering from adrenal fatigue. People today “fast” with poor quality espresso to the point of developing IBS, not to mention the rise of cortisol and adrenaline which further damages their metabolic health. Also short-term fasting reduces blood melatonin levels by even up to 30% in some cases so if you are experiencing insomnia or improper sleep, ask yourself if you are skipping breakfast. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",162
Page 53,"Step 4:Do not check any electronic devices if youdon’t HAVE to (more about blue light in a second). Yes, blue light exposure in the morning is important for a regulated circadian rhythm, BUT, a combination of red light and blue light (the way natural light exists) should be the first thing stimulating your photoreceptors and not man made blue light. If you want to take this a step further, keep in mind that this is optional and not necessary, exposing yourself first thing in the morning to red light from a red light device will speed up the process of resetting your circadian rhythm even further. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",140
Page 54,"Step 5:Either eliminate or minimize your caffeineconsumption to 1 cup before 11 A.M either consumed with a meal or with fats, some carbs and protein. Is caffeine that bad for sleep? Yes it is. If you are a regular coffee drinker you haven’t slept well in years. Caffeine binds to adenosine receptors (adenosine creates a pressure to sleep) making it impossible for your sleep cycles to be optimal. If your liver is fine you will be able to process caffeine just fine, but this does not mean that caffeine’s side effects are limited to sleep problems. Otherwise you wouldn’t be feeling intense withdrawals every time you cut it out. It is a fact that since most people today have never taken anything close to a break from caffeine, that their health will be massively benefited from it and their productivity long term as well. Step 6:a) workout without burning yourself out andb) workout as early in the day as you can (you will see workout splits soon). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",222
Page 55,"A common cause for sleep problems is over training which is surprisingly quite common to the people who are regular gym goers. You do not need to train for 5 hours. You are raising your cortisol and adrenaline levels way too much in order not to face sleep problems. Step 7:Make time to expose your skin to the sun alittle after sunrise, for a brief period mid day and a few minutes before sunset with the additional grounding (do not neglect grounding during the day, it will massively improve your sleep, recovery and reduce the oxidative burden). Even 30 minutes in total can massively help you. Step 8:Block the blue light on your devices and wearblue light blocking glasses. Step 9:Stop working 2-3 before bed time (more ifpossible). Step 10:Get done eating dinner 3 hours before bedand have a fruit + protein snack 45 minutes to 1 hour pre bed. Melatonin peaks around 12AM- 1AM so the ideal time to go to sleep would be 10-10:30. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",217
Page 56,"Melatonin optimization should never be neglected since it is an antioxidant even more powerful than glutathione and suboptimal melatonin regulation will result in severe catabolism of the nervous system. One of the best things that you can do for your nervous system and your productivity, is to make sure that you are sleeping when 12A.M arrives. Step 11:Turn the WiFi off (it is important to limitnnEMF exposure especially when sleeping) and unplug every unnecessary device. The only time i used a sleep measuring device was to measure the effects of WiFi on sleep and they are intense. They affect REM sleep very heavily. Step 12:Make your room as dark as possible, lowerthe light or light candles (melatonin is produced in response to darkness, so trying to sleep in a room which bombards you with blue light, will obviously lead to suboptimal sleep), unplug every unnecessary electronic device, have some magnesium, optional taurine and chamomile tea while you read a fiction book. Also make sure to avoid naps after 3P.M. How many hours should you sleep per night? ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",242
Page 57,"The equivalent of 6 sleep cycles which is 8.5-9 hours on heavy work and workout days but you can do 7.5 on rest days. Note on pineapple and sleep:Yes, pineapple has shownto increase blood levels of melatonin, BUT pineapple should be avoided by the people who have 0 blood types since their stomach acid is already too high in most cases. The worst things that 0 blood types can do for their stomachs are: drink coffee, fast, eat too many veggies, drink booze and eat too much citrus fruit. There are many ways to battle these such as adding glycine in coffee if you HAVE to drink it, drinking bone broth when you have to fast and drinking some colostrum with carrot juice the day after drinking. Pineapple is perfect for every other blood type though and will improve digestion and sleep. The fruit which will improve 0 blood types sleep is kiwi which makes: kiwis+ salt + casein (or some other form of protein) and berries the ideal pre bed snack in order to improve sleep. A pre bed good snack for every blood type is raw honey and raw milk with raw honey. A common reason for insomnia and lack of deep sleep is liver glycogen depletion (reason why your sleep is always going to suck on keto and carnivore (eating raw dairy is not considered carnivore)). The typical sign that someone’s liver glycogen is depleted is waking up in the middle of the night and being unable to go back to sleep. If this is you, start incorporating the above snacks and you will find great benefits in them. What about insulin and carbs? Fructose does not require insulin to go into the cell. Deep sleep and GABA optimization There isn’t one person who suffers from chronic insomnia with optimal GABA function. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",378
Page 58,"GABA is the true sleep promoter. GABA stands for gamma-aminobutyric acid and is the primary mediator of the healthy inhibitory state of metabolism, most associated with sleep and relaxation. The most critical step in GABA optimization is fixing glutamate. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that excites/stimulates nerve cells and plays a big role in learning and memory. Glutamate is the “gas” in your brain and GABA the “breaks”. If these two are not in proper balance, they can lead from things to hyperactivity and anxiety to lethargy (in case of glutamate being “too low”). Some people have “mega-pumped” glutamate in their system due to food additives in the last decades. This can be a long term problem since keeping glutamateand GABA balanced in the brain is a big part of avoiding neurodegenerative conditions (too much glutamate is associated with s diseases such as: Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",228
Page 59,"In order to balance glutamate and GABA we must avoid foods and supplements that “signal” to the body to create glutamate. If you struggle not only with sleep problems but with issues such as anxiety as well, it is best to avoid the following foods for a time period and see if you feel better (not all of these foods are bad exactly, your body simply might need a break from them due to overconsumption of glutamate): - Caffeine. - Nicotine. - Stimulant drugs. - Protein powders. - Seasoning blends (you can make your own which will not be polluted with MSG) - Grains. - High fructose corn syrup. - Any type of sauce. - Canned food. - Corn and cornstarch. - Sweets (except fruit and raw honey). - Non home made chips/popcorn etc. - Egg and milk substitutes. - Artificial flavorings. - Potatoes. - Fermented foods (even pickles) and swiss cheese. - Broccoli, onion and garlic. - Parmesan cheese. - Mushrooms. - Soy products. - Low fat dairy. - Heavy whipping cream. - Food colorings. - Xanthan gum. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",257
Page 60,"- Lentils. - Peas. Important note:In order to balance glutamine andGABA, besides cutting out what we just mentioned, you should also stop working out a)fasted b)with short rest periods c) in the evening and you should start drinking some valerian root tea (do not over do it) about 1 hour before going to bed. Then, make sure to consume enough bioavailable protein during the day (1.8-2 pounds per pound of bodyweight) which is shown to reduce serum glutamate. Bioavailable protein means foods that have a complete amino acid and nutrient profile. The most bioavailable protein sources are : eggs, raw milk (which should never be consumed with a meal but only between meals since it’s too alkaline and can mess up our stomach acid and ability to digest the meal) and of course, meat. So a breakfast(*) that includes eggs, a couple of meals with some meat and sipping raw milk in case someone does not have certain gut issues that we will address later, are a great one week experiment in order for someone to see how enough protein can make him more calm through a reduction in glutamate. (*)Eating breakfast is once more crucial for optimizing GABA since chronic stressful states such as the one of fasting result in the downregulation of GABA’s receptor system. Never underestimate the effect that physical stressful states can have on your mental states. Stress as you will understand on this course is not only mental and physical stress can be even more powerful. Grounding and breathing techniques such as wim hof breathing first thing in the morning will also be beneficial since it has been shown to increase the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system. Also make sure to address gut health as described later on this part since most GABA is produced in the gut to begin with and without a healthy gut no one can be relaxed and have optimal GABA. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",402
Page 61,"Another thing to pay attention and try to minimize is blue light exposure since glutamate is triggered by blue light. When it comes to inositol, IP3 will help you balance GABA, not IP6. IP6 is a great antioxidant and tool for removing heavy metals but it won’t do much for GABA. Also L-Carnosine will upregulate GLT-1 (a glutamate transporter) but do not start with too many supplements. Other sleep boosters with GABA promoting effects are: 1)Passion flower 2)Lemon balm 3)Chamomile tea (safest) Obviously in order to optimize GABA we need to make sure that we have enough nutrients that help synthesize GABA in the first place. These are: Thiamine, vitamin C, vitamin D (if you consider supplementing vitamin D make sure that it is a liquid form, combine it with a liquid form of K2 and also make sure you have enough vitamin A in your system), vitamin A, copper, zinc, magnesium, taurine and vitamin E. Preferred sources of these vitamins, aminos and minerals are: sunlight, berries, pomegranates, beef liver, oysters, lamb, magnesium glycinate and palm kernel oil. Thiamine is the most tricky one since most people are extremely deficient in thiamine and will require some form of supplementation. Thiamine is important since GABA promotes cellular regeneration through a rise in CO2. A deficiency of GABA can also not be improved until sodium levels are restored and a thiamine deficiency is probably the number 1 cause of such a deficiency since to acquire the needed sodium and potassium regulators is pretty relatively easy. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",354
Page 62,"A magnesium deficiency will also lead to glutamate overactivity and supplementing magnesium citrate (small dose) in the morning and magnesium glycinate (regular dose) for a brief period of time (3-6 weeks) will help prevent and fix this. When it comes to zinc, during GABA activity certain pathways in our body swap copper for zinc, so without enough zinc this swap can not happen. For deeper discussions in nutrition and supplements you can check the specific lessons and chapters when the time comes. Last but not least, in order to optimize GABA, you need to get sunlight at least 3 times a day. The reason why insomnia often occurs in wintertime or in people who spend plenty of time inside, is not due to melatonin, contrary to popular belief but because of GABA. If that’s the case for you, then provide enough antioxidants in your system through foods like berries, cherries, acerola cherries, pomegranate juice with no pulp and vitamin A from beef liver (never combine these) and start spending as much time outside as you can. Then if you start getting extremely tired by 12-2P.M suboptimal GABA was your insomnia cause. Bonus : GABA tonic recipes GABA tonic #1 (as a pre workout in order to manage cortisol response) - Chamomile - Ginger - Raw honey - Coconut water - Salt - Taurine - L theanine ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",300
Page 63,"GABA tonic #2 (pre bed) - Chamomile - Glycine - Raw honey - Magnesium glycinate - Acerola cherry juice GABA tonic #3 (anytime) - Grapefruit juice (no pulp) - Orange juice (no pulp) - Salt - Coconut water - Magnesium glycinate - L theanine Caution: Do NOT drink valerian root tea with glycine. Also progesterone can help with optimizing GABA as well, but i would not start from there. Taking ashwagandha will do nothing for sleep long term and since it’s a glandular supplement (same with maca, rhodiola, green tea, matcha and so on) it could even exacerbate adrenal fatigue which brings us to our next point of discussion which is. Deep sleep and adrenal fatigue Our adrenal glands produce a variety of hormones such as cortisol, aldosterone and adrenaline. These adrenal hormones help regulate several bodily functions including metabolism, blood pressure, our body's response to stress and sleep. Now the term ""adrenal fatigue"" refers to inadequate production of one or more of these hormones as a result of an underlying disease or surgery. Signs and symptoms of adrenal fatigue may include: ●Fatigue ●Body aches ●Unexplained weight loss ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",282
Page 64,"●Low blood pressure ●Lightheadedness ●Loss of body hair ●Skin discoloration Adrenal fatigue can be diagnosed by blood tests that show inadequate levels of adrenal hormones. Proponents of the adrenal fatigue diagnosis claim this is a mild form of adrenal Adrenal fatigue simply means that your adrenal glands are unable to keep up with the demands of the fight-or-flight arousal. The adrenal glands secrete cortisol which greatly regulates sleep and thus adrenal fatigue is can be a cause of sleep problems. Bullet points to improve adrenal fatigue Number 1:Stop fasting. Get 3 meals a day in and 1-2 possible snacks coming from quality food sources that are demonstrated during this program (obviously, the meal plan that you received, has this covered) Number 2:If your diet has been low in vitamin C,up the dietary vitamin C through sources such as camu camu and acerola cherry since under the state of adrenal fatigue, the adrenal glands dumb vitamin C at a very high rate and vitamin C is something very crucial for the health of our endocrine system (this depletion of vitamin C is one of the reasons why people get sick when stressed (obviously there are many more reasons why this happens)). Number 3:Make sure that you have addressed oxidativestress as you read on module 1.2. Number 4:Address the health of mast cells. A mast cell is a type of white blood cell and is found in connective tissues throughout your body. Mast cells help your immune system function properly and normally help protect us from disease. Mast cells synthesize and secrete histamine, proteases,prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes, heparin and a variety of cytokines which all contribute to the release of stress hormones to various degrees. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",385
Page 65,"We will address this by firstadding foods that stabilize mast cells (how antihistamine drugs work). These include: ●Chamomile ●Turmeric ●Ginger ●Apples (skin off in order to avoid the pesticides and herbicides) ●Peaches (skin off) And then adding natural mast cell inhibitors which are : 1) Quercetin Quercetin inhibits the mast cells and stabilizes cortisol. Quercetin is fat soluble so you’ll need to consume it with a fatty meal in order to increase the absorption. Quercetin has a half life of 2 hours, so after the first 2 days that you’ll take it once in order to see if you have some negative reaction to it, you’re going to up it to 3 times a day. 2) Oysters Low levels of zinc can lead to a histamine intolerance since the zinc chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) inhibits the release of histamine, the production of cytokines, and the secretion of lipid mediators in mast cells. Also a zinc deficiency greatly promotes an adrenaline excess so oysters will help you with this as well. 3) Black cumin seed oil Black cumin seed oil has great antihistamine effects and is one of the most studied natural remedies that has been utilized for its medicinal properties for over two thousand years. Blackseed oil is superior to all other natural anti microbiotics for one more reason. When things such as oregano oil wipe out all pathogenic microorganisms (this includes the good strains of bacteria as well), black cumin seed oil attacks the pathogenic and spoilage bacteria but not good strains such as lactobacillus. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",383
Page 66,"Cat’s claw can also have a similar effect but never start with such an intense tool* 4) Binders such as apple pectin, activated charcoal and zeolites at night. POS (pectic oligosaccharides) found in pectins can be used as an inhibitor in regulating mast cell-mediated allergic inflammatory responses. Other bindests such as AC and zeolites, work in a similar way and we will talk more about them on the heavy metal detox part of the program. 5) Avoid pesticides, herbicides and artificial fragrances since all of them are potential allergens. Sleep apnea and snoring Sleep apnoea is when your breathing stops and starts while you sleep. The most common type is called obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Unconsciously holding your breath during sleep, is a sign of low metabolic rate since your body attempts to preserve spare CO2 and oxygen by holding your breath. Step 0:If you smoke, quit smoking. Without this we can’t improve the condition. If you have trouble quitting smoking : a) stabilize your blood sugar levels as you will see on how to optimize glucose metabolism part of this lesson and b)get on creatine for a few weeks in order to not feel so intense withdrawals and use ginkgo biloba (other strategies on how to optimize dopamine that are demonstrated on how to optimize your mood part of the program can be helpful as well). Step 1:Breathe through your nose and rest your tongueat the top of your pallet. It is estimated that about 30 to 50 percent of adults breathe through their mouths. If you breathe through your mouth you’re damaging your health and changing the way your face looks. When nasal breathing is blocked, mouth breathing leads to the development of long, narrow faces with crooked teeth, receded jaw, can cause TMD (temporomandibular joint dysfunction), gum disease, brain fog and headaches. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",415
Page 67,"One more reason why breathing through your nose is important, is because when you breathe through the nose, you are forcing air through structures that heat, humidify, filter (which plays a big role for our immune system) and pressure the air so when it gets to your lungs in can be more easily “uploaded” to your bloodstream. This is why we can extract about 20 per cent more oxygen breathing through our noses than we can breathing through our mouths. A lot of people are mouth breathers due to allergies. If this is the case, besides cleaning up your diet and removing potential allergens (pesticides, xenoestrogens etc), checking your vitamin D levels, addressing unbound iron as demonstrated on the heavy metal detox part and adding local bee pollen and local raw honey into your diet will work great as well. So when you catch yourself breathing through your mouth, consciously shift your attention back into breathing from your nose. Step 2:Stop eating a high inflammatory diet madeof mucus promoting foods and stick to a low histamine diet as the one prescribed in the gut healing part. Step 3:Battle sleep apnea’s reactive oxygen specieswith antioxidants such as vitamin C and E coming from whole foods prior to going to sleep. Step 4:Stop using fragrances and unnatural cosmeticproducts since reactive oxygen species are generated as a response to xenobiotics as well. For every toxic fragrance and cosmetic product there is a natural alternative which is also more effective as you will see on the xenoestrogen detox part. Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance due to excess ROS or oxidants over the capability of the cell to mount an effective antioxidant response Step 5:Optimize CO2 throughsunlight, quality carbohydratessuch as seasonal fruit and raw honey, optimize your thyroid as you will see in the thyroid part and use some of the following techniques as well.

Page 68,"Note: C02 is very essential for our metabolic health since it stabilizes and even activates mitochondria. Note:Increasing CO2 can acidify the body for thepeople who don’t have enough calcium and calcium regulators in their system. So making sure that one consumes enough magnesium, vitamin K2, vitamin D (preferably from sunlight) and some raw goat’s dairy or organic goat’s dairy can also be beneficial in the case that the person was not consuming any. What about bag breathing to increase CO2? Both yes and no. Trying to force the rise of C02 can lead to stress and is better if it’s accomplished through the natural process of optimizing one's metabolism. The Buteyko breathing technique which is also great for asthma, will help you with increasing CO2 levels as well. NaturallycarbonatedwaterisaneffectivetooltoraiseCO2levels,italso improvesthedeliveryofbloodtothebrain,stopstheplateletsfromreleasing excess serotonin and from histidine to turn into histamine as well. Bathing in natural springs in the case that they are near by you, can have a great effect as well. Using sea salt and baking soda as a pre workout supplement (use with caution obviously and not all the time) besides thiamine, can also greatly help increase the tissue content of CO2 by lowering lactic acid which is antagonistic to CO2. Improving the methionine:glycine ratio by adding bone marrow and supplemental glycine can also greatly help a person increase C02 levels as well, but balancing the methionine:glycine ratio has benefits that exceed the increase of CO2. For example, excess methylation has been shown to exacerbate and even trigger autoimmune conditions, autistic spectrum disorders and severely worsen PTSD.

They are becoming more and more popular and cheaper as a result of this. Hidden causes of sleep problems. Number 1: Plant toxins Phytic acid Phytic acid is a molecule designed to prevent leaching of nutrients out of the plant and is found in large concentrations in grains, legumes, dark leafy green nuts and seeds. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",393
Page 70,"The problem with phytic acid when it comes to sleep (since phytic acid leads to many problems), is that it prevents calcium from being absorbed and calcium helps the brain to manufacture the sleep-inducing substance melatonin. So, do not over consume vegetables and when you do: a) slow cook them in animal fats in order to lower the anti nutrient content and peel the skin off in things such as potatoes and carrots since the skin is the part of the plan with the most antinutrients. This is why raw greens taste less pleasant than cooked ones. Our tongue senses the presence of phytic acid and signals to us that this green thing is something that we should avoid (at least in that particular form). When it comes to nuts and seeds: a)do not over consume them and b)always sprout them in order to again lower the antinutrient content. Solanine Solanine is commonly found in nightshades such as the potatoes, tomatoes, eggplants and peppers. Solanine over-stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system (it can even cause neurological damage in large amounts) and can cause issues such as anxiety and insomnia. Failure to remove phytic acid from the diet means that it binds all calcium, magnesium, and other important nutrients in the digestive tract and thus entirely prevents their absorption. Number 2: Serotonin excess. Most myths around serotonin have been busted so far and people realize now that’s actually a stress hormone and if you want to be high on one thing that thing is dopamine and not serotonin. A serotonin excess produces many problems such as: IBS, cancer, neurological damage, anxiety, mood disorders, hair loss, hypothyroidism, headaches, migraines, low testosterone, fertility problems and it impairs our learning ability. A serotonin excess will lead to dopamine and GABA imbalances and thus sleep problems (especially with REM sleep). General symptoms that are linked with serotonin excess are the following. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",418
Page 71,"-Fears and phobias. -Generalized anxiety. -Robotic obedience. -Learned helplessness. -Mood instability. -Over analytical personality (stress sourced). How to get rid of excessive serotonin cheat sheet. Binder salad. This salad is made up of: chopped carrots (not grinded, chopped), avocado, ginger, 30-40 grams of beef liver, blackseed oil, coconut oil and sea salt. You can have it in between meals a few times a week (3-4). The fibers in raw carrots will bind to excessive estrogen, the ginger will lower serotonin receptivity in the gut and the blackseed oil since it can lower serotonin uptake from the gut. Why did we add the liver? Beta carotene puts on overdrive the body’s needs for vitamin A (retinol) and since most people are vitamin A deficient to begin with, a salad without this can result in negative effects in the reproductive organs down the line. So instead of consuming 200 grams of liver once per week, I recommend combining beta carotene with retinol via this salad 4 times per week (which add to 100-200 grams of liver per week). Detox from xenoestrogens the specific way that will be presented to you soon. Pay attention especially to the sauna step and activated charcoal. Supplement ginkgo bilobawhich can normalize elevatedcatecholamine and lowers serotonin since it has opposite effects of serotonin ( it increases blood flow to the brain (serotonin reduces it)). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",327
Page 72,"Lower stress through grounding, fructose, vitamin C and E. Pomegranates, berries, grapefruit, EVOO and palm kernel oil will provide all of the above nutrients. Drink a cup of bone broth between your mealsin orderfor glycine to mitigate the excessive tryptophan (a serotonin agonist) that comes from a lot of animal products. Glycine basically aids serotonin clearance. Address gut health. Especially candida and SIBO which we will discuss in a few pages. 2-4 free range whole eggs a day for the choline benefits. Choline increases dopamine receptor densities and can even ameliorate memory impairment. Do not fast. Dopamine deficiency which can affect serotonin excess sometimes occurs when people are extremely stressed because adrenaline is actually made from dopamine. If you’re a fasting maniac, you’re obviously pumping adrenaline like a maniac and this should be avoided. Optimize DHT in order to lower serotonin synthesis. More about androgens in the next lesson, but for now first of all avoid things that lower DHT such as most nuts and seeds, saw palmetto, reishi mushroom, lion's mane and other medicinal mushrooms. Second of all, if you want to use supplements, DHEA and pregnenolone can help given that you have enough vitamin A (retinol) in your system, but make sure to read the entire course first, in order to gain a better understanding on how to use supplements. A “safer” so to speak supplement that a lot of people will also benefit from, will be niacinamide which has great antiestrogenic properties in general and which we will discuss in depth later in this lesson. Cocoa butter and boron can help you optimize DHT under this context as well. The anti aromatase effects of fat soluble vitamins will also help boost DHT (some of them indirectly). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",405
Page 73,"Optimizing thyroid performance will obviously help optimize DHT as well. Last but not least glycine can stimulate 5AR. Eat a macronutrient balanced dinner. At night when we are asleep adrenaline is expressed in order to release glycogen from tissue storage to keep our organs and metabolism running. If you don’t have any food in your system the adrenaline will lead to all shorts of messes which will result in again, dopamine deficiency. Mandatory weekly oysters. A promoter of adrenaline excess is zinc deficiency. So never forget to eat your weekly serving of oysters. Get on thiamine (B1). Most people are thiamine deficient (both due to the lack of dietary thiamine but also a compromised gut) and a deficiency in thiamine increases serotonin production. You will learn more about B vitamins and how to properly use them in the entire course. Balance tryptophan with the other amino acids. Add glycine once a day, a side of bone marrow once a day and some grass fed gelatin can also be an option once in a while in case that you can not find quality bone marrow. Lower stress since stress stimulates serotonin production. When and only when you are sleep deprived and very tiredit is useful to supplement creatine in order to lower the excess serotonin. Deep sleep, calcium and vitamin D In order to optimize sleep, we need to optimize our metabolism in any other way we can. Sleep is actually a high metabolic state despite what most people think so if a person’s metabolism is suboptimal to begin with, he will of course face troubles sleeping. There are many ways to optimize one’s metabolism and all of them are equally important in the long run, but there are 2 main things that directly affect sleep. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",372
Page 74,"Calcium:Phosphorus ratio and vitamin D levels. Without enough (bioavailable) calcium, phosphorus’ energetic potential can not be contained and used, so it will lead to cellular damage and suboptimal metabolic rate. So one big reason for suboptimal metabolic health and thus poor sleep is the improper Calcium:Phosphorus ratio. Note: without the proper calcium regulators such as magnesium, vitamin D and K2 (which are both great anti-calcification factors and can thus be used to improve pineal function, bone health and improve prostate problems as well) calcium begins to saturate cells more than it should as well and cause insomnia (magnesium for example directs excessive calcium outside the cell). So first, you should implement everything we have discussed so far and not make too many changes at once because you will not be able to pinpoint at what was most effective. Then if you are still suffering from insomnia, having a sufficient intake of both calcium and magnesium , especially before bed will be crucial. But eliminating all grains, legumes, seeds, nuts and most uncooked vegetables for 4 weeks at this point will be crucial as well since oxalic and phytic acid block, displace or bind calcium and prevent it from being absorbed and utilized from the body. A side of bone broth between meals and the elimination of phosphoric beverages such as coca cola (any type) for another 4 weeks will also be crucial. I recommend sticking to the thyroid supportive plan that is presented in this lesson in order to prevent the parathyroid from facilitating the leaching of calcium from bones and even soft tissue calcification. Note: Calcium will obviously not lead to kidney stones as doctors sometimes say since kidney stones indicate a magnesium and vitamin D deficiency as well as an excess of parathyroid hormone. When it comes to calcium sources, eggshell powder can be a great source of bioavailable calcium but a lot of people face low stomach acid problems and it is best to be avoided at the moment. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",421
Page 75,"We address gut health in detail later, but for now keep in mind the the three most effective sources for calcium besides eggshells powder will be organic goat cheese, organic unflavoured casein protein and, unfortunately this is very schizo, add a splash of vinegar, 250-500 μg of artificial b12 and some raw honey to organic milk. I know how this sounds, but this is the only way to precipitate the calcium and phosphorus and also make the calcium more bioavailable. Now, vitamin D obviously has many key roles in one’s metabolism but sleep wise, vitamin D is required to make calcium bioavailable and optimize the calcium:phosphorus ratio. Sunlight is obviously the preferred source of vitamin D, but this can be inhibited by some things we will mention in a few pages and one should focus on exposing himself to the sunlight the right way. What i want to mention about vitamin D at this stage of the course is that vitamin D requires butyric acid from indigestible carbohydrates such as pectins in order to be absorbed and utilized properly. This is one of the reasons why i have seen carnivores who literally spent 8 hours outside in the sun every day with 15ng/dL. So the people who still suffer from insomnia after implementing everything that we have said and even after getting plenty of sunlight on a constant basis, should try consuming some pectins with breakfast and a liquid vitamin D3+K2 formula with lunch for 1-4 weeks. If this is the root problem of their insomnia (vitamin D) the effects should become noticeable from day 3 up to 2 weeks. The last thing that i will mention is that people experience insomnia because they have never taken a deload week or week off the gym in their entire lives and should take a break since their CNS is more fried than they might think. Combating sleep problems in the winter. The winter creates sleep problems for a lot of people mostly due to the rise of stress hormones and reduction in progesterone. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",422
Page 76,"Darkness is identified as a stress as it impairs energy production and causes chronic rises in adrenaline as well. The body cannot differentiate darkness between a dark room or night time resulting in the release of stress chemicals. I actually tell clients to dial in their diets in the winter way more than in the summer. This means that if you are experiencing sleep problems when winter time arrives and you have not cleaned up your diet already it’s time for you to slowly improve it. The winter inevitably comes with an absence of light and this has multiple catabolic effects in our biology especially for the ones that have been avoiding the sunlight during the summer for years. So the first step is getting a cheap red light device or even lamp which you will use to expose yourself to red light once after you wake up and once at sunset. Red light helps cells produce energy and synthesize protective steroid hormones such as progesterone. Red light will also reduce stress hormones that are being released as a result of darkness. Something as simple as getting red light on your skin, can have such a profound effect upon your metabolism, estrogen dominance, energy, mood and fat synthesis. Which brings us to the fact that we need to address a very possible estrogen dominance. More details about this will be given in lesson 2 but here’s what you need to know for now. What estrogens have to do with sleep problems during the winter? Both progesterone and cortisol are released from our adrenal glands. During the winter the absence of light can not only create a progesterone deficiency to begin with but also increase cortisol and adrenaline that will lead to an estrogen dominant state. Any stressful state will directly reduce the production of progesterone and less progesterone = more estrogen. Before considering any possible progesterone supplementation, you should try the following for 2-3 weeks. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",385
Page 77,"First of all if you are a man with over 20% body fat and a woman with over 25% body fat, read the guide on how to effortlessly get lean which will help you lose some weight in a pro metabolic way. Fat tissue is a part of our hormonal system and our fat tissue contains aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen. So after a certain body fat percentage, the more fat you have the more estrogen you will have. Now the more estrogen you have the less active thyroid hormone you will have which will also result in sleep problems. That was step 1. Step 2 is addressing xenoestrogens (which include birth control pills) ( i had clients with intense sleep problems simply because they were trying to sleep in clothes made out of polyester) and PUFAs as you will read on the PUFA and xenoestrogen detox guides. Step 3 is having the binder salad 4 times a week which will help you reduce excess estrogen since the fibers of the carrot will attach to any unused endotoxins and help flush them out of the body. Step 4 is getting rid of alcohol and phytoestrogens which can also inhibit the conversion of T4 to T3 and slow metabolism. Step 5 is to not over do it with cardio which can reduce thyroid hormone and increase estrogen. Step 6 is to check your vitamin D status since vitamin D is necessary for the conversion of hormones. Step 7 is to reduce stress if possible (re-read GABA optimization for this) which will allow your adrenal glands to produce more progesterone. Step 8 if this was not obvious, still spend as much time under natural light as possible during the day in order to boost the synthesis of sex hormones and reduce excess estrogen. Step 9 is to increase the calcium during the winter from sources such as eggshell powder after optimizing gut health in order to reduce parathyroid stress hormone. Step 10 is to make sure to consume enough saturated fats since adequate saturated fat helps men to produce more testosterone and women more progesterone. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",423
Page 78,"Optional step 11 is to consider either gelatin or supplementing glycine since glycine has an inhibitory effect on estrogen’s action and can help offset excess estrogen. Optional step 12 after making sure that you have been following the diet principles on this course would be to supplement a small dose of pregnenolone every other day or even twice a week. But just as beta carotene puts the body’s needs of retinol on overdrive, so does pregnenolone. Pregnenolone is what is called the “mother hormone” and is the raw material for producing many of the steroid and protective hormones such as DHEA and progesterone. Since pre-cursors are more effective than the actual thing most of the time, your first step (in case that you are not a woman over 30) should be trying pregnenolone and not progesterone for sleep problems during the winter. If you are a woman over 30 with symptoms of estrogen dominance(*), you have experienced lots of stress the last period or even years and suffer from suboptimal metabolic health, you can try short term progesterone supplementation which is something thatshould bealways cycled. If you are a man over 30 with intense sleep problems, symptoms of estrogen dominance and adrenal fatigue, you can try short term DHEA supplementation. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone that our bodies naturally produce mainly in the adrenal gland and helps in the production of other hormones such as testosterone and progesterone. Obviously, all of these supplements are short term tools to get the ball rolling faster, you don’t have to rely on supplements to get decent sleep after a certain point. Estrogen dominance is actually a lack of progesterone – or when the actions of estrogen are greater than that of progesterone . (*)Symptoms of estrogen dominance include: ●Fat storage (hips, butts and thighs in women and belly fat in men) ●Irritability/Outbursts ●Water retention ●Bloating ●Gynecomastia ●Fertility problems ●PMS ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",452
Page 79,"●Savory cravings (especially for things such as grapefruit) ●Cellulite ●Headaches ●Mood swings ●Poor sleep or insomnia ●Miscarriage ●Fibroids ●Heavy menstrual bleeding ●Irregular menstruation ●Hot flushes/flashes ●Hair Loss ●Varicose veins ●Dry skin ●Joint pains / stiffness ●Lack of flexibility ●Candida / fungal infection ●Histamine intolerance ●Enlarged prostate ●Hypoglycemia ●Autoimmune disease ●Breast/Prostate Cancer Now other common reasons that most people have not experienced a good night of deep and restful sleep in years are the following. -Non optimal liver function (we address this on thyroid) -Vitamin B12 deficiency (very common and we mention how to properly address this on the gut part (same lesson)) -Adrenal fatigue (pregnenolone could help after making sure that you have enough vitamin A and B vitamins in your system as we said) -Zinc:Copper imbalance in case that you do not consume any organ meats, shellfish and are taking a zinc supplement for a long period of time -Sodium fluoride excess -Overtraining -High protein, low carb dinners ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",267
Page 80,"-Vitamin C deficiency -Pathogenic microbes (we address this in the gut part) -Fried dopamine receptors from things like porn and excessive social media use -Heavy metal toxicity (see the heavy metal detox part) -Chronic nnEMF toxicity (start with grounding and magnesium, besides managing the exposure) -Medication such as minoxidil -Collagen powders -Inositol deficiency -Imbalance of methionine:glycine Module 1.4: Improving our metabolic health with sunlight A light deficiency directly inhibits mitochondria. Our light environments matter. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",134
Page 81,"⅔ of our ATP levels are dependent on our light environment. Light of different wave-lengths has the potential to interact with four major mitochondrial protein complexes that are involved in the generation of ATP. Neurones of the central nervous system have an absolute dependence on mitochondrial generated ATP. Laboratory studies show that short-wave or blue light (400–480 nm) that impinges on the retina affect flavin and cytochrome constituents associated with mitochondria to decrease the rate of ATP formation, stimulate ROS and result in cell death. This suggests that blue light could potentially have a negative influence on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) mitochondria that are abundant and not shielded by macular pigments as occurs for photoreceptor mitochondria. Long-wave or red light (650–800 nm) affects mitochondrial complex IV or cytochrome oxidase to increase the rate of formation of ATP and ROS causing the generation of a number of beneficial factors. Significantly, laboratory studies show that increasing the normal amount of natural red light reaching rat RGC mitochondria in situ, subjected to ischemia, proved to be beneficial. The first step for optimizing our light environment is addressing blue light (which is also crucial for GABA optimization but i wanted to mention it here in more detail). One of the big reasons that we are sick, depressed, anxious, diabetic, have wild food cravings and our eyesight is getting pretty bad, is artificial blue light. Our mitochondria and light are extremely connected as we said so our light environment greatly determines our mitochondrial health and as a result our health in general. Blue light exists in nature and has many benefits for our well being. But the downsides of blue light in nature are balanced by the red light that also exists in nature (this is the reason why a lot of blue light blocking glasses can be red-ish). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",390
Page 82,"This obviously is not the case for artificial blue light. You have all the downside without the upside. You have all the stimulation that’s causing you insomnia, heart problems, diabetes, ages you, messes up your dopamine and serotonin without any upside. Artificial blue light is not “bad” in an absolute way exactly. It has helped us save millions of lives (in the ER for example) but we have stopped treating it as a tool and that's harming us. You won’t die if you expose yourself to artificial blue light on a random night. But are you exposing yourself to it once in a blue moon or are you bombarded with it through smart phones, TVs, tablets, poorly manufactured light bulbs and computer screens from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to bed? This will obviously cause a lot of damage long term. So the question is, are you using it as a tool or you don’t even recognise that it is a tool which you shouldn’t be using if you don’t need it? Our light environment determines our health way more than we probably realize. Take professional video gamers for example. Some people think that they live off junk food and energy drinks, this is true in a lot of cases but in the last few years a lot of them have been eating super clean, working out like maniacs and living very healthy lifestyles but they are still sick and depressed. Why? Well, they live in an unnatural environment which leads to unnatural reactions. Our light environment affects everything because our mitochondria affect everything. You wanna know also why the memes about guys who spent all day in front of a computer portray them filled with acne? It’s because one of the causes of acne can be insulin resistance and blue light can directly cause this. Videogamers very rarely stop being in front of a computer at night time. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",398
Page 83,"The problem with this is that just one night of moderate blue light exposure increases next-morning insulin resistance. Just one night. Blue light messes up with your insulin response without you consuming a single calorie. You’ve probably experienced this yourself the times you have spent hours at night in an environment filled with blue light (on a night out, a festival etc). At the end of the night you probably had some wild cravings and this is not a coincidence since blood sugar drops can lead to cravings and as we said blue light at night messes up with your insulin responses. It’s no wonder also why the people who work night shifts are depressed, fat, diabetic, irritable and have heart problems. They spent years of their lives under the most toxic light known to man. As a joke once, i wore the blue light blockers a friend had at a festival once and had zero, ZERO, food cravings by the end of it despite the fact that i had 3 or 4 drinks and alcohol messes up your blood sugar very badly (the main reason you crave junk when you drink besides dopamine). So is artificial blue light at night messing us up even more than alcohol? Could very well be. After all, it has shown to affect pretty bad cancer cells in a lot of studies. The reason for this probably is that artificial blue light exposure at night stops the secretion of melatonin. Melatonin is one of the very few things that actually keeps us healthy and prevents disease by repairing mitochondria. When you mess up with melatonin, well, you stop preventing disease and basically invite cancer or another form of metabolic disease. Also melatonin besidesbeing a free radical scavenger reduces nitricoxide generation within mitochondria. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",364
Page 84,"It maintains the electron flow, efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, ATP production and bioenergetic function of the cell. Artificial blue light makes everyone slightly depressed nowadays since it lacks red light (among others) resulting in (this is a medical wrong term) dopamine dysregulation. In case you’re suffering from depression you should spend as little time under artificial light as you can. Sunlight has a clinical effect on people suffering from depression. Hospital patients with depression who stay in brighter rooms are on average admitted for30 days fewerthan patients who stayedin darker rooms. Many studies have shown that sunlight can decrease depression scores and even increase cognitive performance. After all, yellow is characterized as the happiest color and has been used for decades in light therapy to improve the mood of people who suffer with mood disorders. Blue light toxicity can even cause panic attacks since glutamate is the neurotransmitter of the neurons of the vertical pathways through the retina and all photoreceptor types, rods and cones use glutamate to transmit signals to the next order neuron in the chain. (More about glutamate and what it is in a few pages). Blue light also severely damages our eyesight and retinas. There is evidence that artificial blue light can thin our retina and damage our eyes in general. One more problem this produces is that when you mess up your photoreceptors, you mess up your body’s ability to use light and regulate a lot of important functions such as your digestion, glucose metabolism and your circadian rhythm. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",313
Page 85,"So, here’s the main lesson. If you want to optimal mitochondrial health, you should expose yourself to as little artificial blue light as you can at night, while you also: a) start wearing blue light blocking glasses and block the blue light on your phone, tablet and computer by using blue light blocking programs, b) spend as much time in outside as you can and c) try not to each too much after the sun is down (under blue light). Moving on now to sunlight. Sun gives life to everything on this earth. Without the sun , everything will die. Every animal , human and plant needs sun in order to function and grow properly. If sunlight causes cancer, we would have gone extinct many years ago. We need the sun for so many biochemical processes it is hard to mention even 1/1.000.000 of them. Without the sun , your health will deteriorate pretty fat in multiple areas. Your testosterone, your insulin sensitivity, your muscles, your CNS, your eyes, your skin, your mood, your focus, your energy. Every single one of these things will take a hit and no amount of vitamins and medication can undo the damages from lack of sun exposure. Sunlight is way more effective than a lot of steroids (it can even double your testosterone levels and significantly lowers insulin resistance), antidepressants and medication for common diseases in general. Early sunlight exposure can even reverse some of the symptoms of the damage blue light has done to the skin and eyes (obviously do not look directly at the sun). Sunlight exposure is also crucial for our T cell function and without this we pretty much have no defense against foreign pathogens. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",347
Page 86,"10 rules for safe sun exposure Number 1: Since our skin is made out of the things that we eat, do not consume any of the following : inferior fats such as canola oil, soybean oil, corn oil and in general oils that are easily oxidized (see the PUFA awareness and detox protocol), margarine, sugar, unsprouted grains, soy, legumes, artificial sweeteners, soy, alcohol, coffee (you can apply coffee on your skin though and it can protect it from oxidative damage) and nicotine (using nicotine under the sun, will increase free radicals too much and lead to skin aging). Your diet should include the following foods : free range eggs, quality dairy, red meat, saturated fats, bone marrow, fruits high in vitamin C (do not combine foods high in iron high in vitamin C) , seafood such as oysters (for copper and zinc) ,organ meats and some cacao. Note: An ideal breakfast would be eggs cooked in coconut oil and seasonal fruit. If your iron levels are not low, adding turmeric with black pepper on your eggs a few times per week (daily use can lower DHT long term) is a very efficient dopamine booster that will also activate vitamin D receptors. Number 2: Gradually expose yourself to the sun. Start only by sunbathing for 5-15 minutes at sunrise and sunset. You should never burn, your skin should never become red when you sunbathe. Number 3: Moisturize with aloe vera. This is actually super important and since your skin is an organ, by hydrating from outside in, you can reduce some of the stress hormones sunbathing can produce and it will also lead to a better tan. Number 4: Up the vitamin C. The days you sunbathe, you are going to need anywhere from 300mg all the way to even 1.000mg of vitamin C per day depending on how much time you spend under the sun. You can get even up to 500mg of vitamin C from your diet, but it might be a good idea to use a supplement form of vitamin C that is coming from whole foods (acerola cherry ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",453
Page 87,"powder, camu camu powder and things of this nature) in moderation as well prior to sun exposure. Number 5: 100-200mg of magnesium in the morning since the sun can a)deplete you of magnesium and b) magnesium leads to a better tan. But, do not supplement magnesium in the middle of the day since it can affect the absorption of vitamin D levels. Number 6: Start consuming beta carotene 4-7 times a week preferably from pumpkin, squash and carrots. Number 7: Do not neglect the fat soluble vitamins and saturated fats. Both of them protect and moisturize your skin. Number 8: Do not shower with hot water and end up dehydrating your skin. Number 9: If you have to spend a lot of time in the sun you should apply mineral based sunscreen. Number 10: Ideally you want to sunbathe barefoot/grounded in order to reduce ROS. Number 11: Do not wear glasses, contacts or sunglasses when out in the sun unless you have to since you will mess up the photoreceptors that signal your body to produce both melanin and melatonin. Note:If sunlight hits your skin through any typeof glass for a lot of hours that’s not good and you should use mineral based sunscreen. Before we continue, a note on glycogen. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",282
Page 88,"Glycogen is the stored form of glucose that’s made up of many connected glucose molecules. Glucose is our main source of energy and comes fromcarbohydrates. When our bodies don’t immediately need glucose from the food you eat for energy, it stores glucose primarily in our liver(*), muscles(**), kidneys and intestines. This stored glycogen then is used as an immediate energy source (the body’s preferred fuel) and provides energy to the brain and red blood cells. Our bodies create glycogen from glucose through a process called glycogenesis (the body breaks down glycogen for use through a process called glycogenolysis). Glycogen and glucose are related to how your body uses its main source of energy from carbohydrates, but they have different functions. We get glucose from carbohydrates in the food we eat and it’s the primary source of energy for our brains which have a constant requirement for glucose. Now glycogen comes from your body digesting these carbohydrates and turning them into glucose so it can use it for fuel. So, glycogen is the stored form of glucose. (*)Our bodies mainly use the stored glycogen in our liver to help regulate blood glucose (sugar) levels with the hormones glucagon and insulin. The glycogen stores in the liver also help with exercise. At the start of exercise, your liver begins breaking down glycogen to maintain blood glucose levels as your working muscles use it for energy. However, your muscles primarily use their own glycogen stores to function. (**)Muscle glycogen serves mainly as a source of metabolic fuel for your muscles and if your muscles relied on glucose from your bloodstream for this energy, your body would quickly run out of glucose so the body stores 3/4 of your total glycogen in all of your skeletal muscles. Module 1.5: How to optimize glucose metabolism. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",396
Page 89,"We started by mentioning the pro-metabolic and anti-metabolic compounds, sleep and sunlight, since properly addressing these you can not optimize glucose metabolism. It is literally impossible. For example, PUFAs are a bigger cause for diabetes than sugar and we’re obviously not crazy at all for stating that. It’s not rocket science if you understand that the consumption of inferior fats destroys our ability to metabolize carbs in general. It goes back to the fact that they cause oxidative destruction of mitochondria which oxidize carbohydrates for energy. PUFAs remodel the cardiolipin(*) structure of mitochondria causing cellular death and leakage of potassium they destroy our metabolism. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",152
Page 90,"(*)Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, which is exclusively located in mitochondria and plays an important role in regulating various kinds of mitochondrial proteins such as electron transport complexes, carrier proteins and phosphate kinases, and is also essential for the organization of particular mitochondrial structures such as cristae and contact sites. PUFA metabolites (leukotrienes) are so damaging for our health that they can even trigger Type 1 diabetes whichis an autoimmunecondition (the beta-cells of the pancreas get attacked by the immune system and over time this leads to their destruction and inability to produce insulin). We have dedicated an entire chapter to PUFAs in this lesson but for now you must keep in mind that you should avoid sunflower oil, almond oil, canola oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, flaxseed oil, fish oil, rapeseed oil and in general oils that did not exist 2000 years ago like the plague if you want to optimize glucose metabolism and metabolic health as a result of that. Cutting out these specific PUFAs is a crucial step to restoring proper sugar (sugar is a broad term, it does not mean literally sugar) oxidation since the presence of PUFAs inhibits the kynurenine pathway. The kynurenine pathway is a metabolic pathway leading to the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). Prolonged disequilibrium of NAD+ metabolism results in every metabolic disease possible. NAD’s function in the body is to shuttle electrons from processes which obtain energy from food to those which then use that energy. In simple terms, this pathway promotes the proper metabolism of carbohydrates and the most important vitamin for this pathway is the NAD precursor ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",372
Page 91,niacinamide (B3). The third priority for optimizing glucose metabolism is not going low carb (it might be going lower carb) but replenishing B vitamins and magnesium. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC,49
Page 92,"As you can see, these two are crucial for the citric acid cycle that we mentioned prior in this program and a deficiency in these 2 (which is not uncommon) is enough to cause severe metabolic problems. Carbs have been demonized for way too long and a low carb diet does nothing for addressing the above serious deficiencies most of the time. Carbs are not the problem, suboptimal ability to metabolize carbs is the problem. Carb intolerance is a sign that our ability to oxidize carbohydrates needs improvement, and not that carbohydrates are bad, which will only end up exacerbating the problem since carbohydrate deficiency decreases the body’s ability to respond to stress and thus increases the severity of the effects of such stress upon organs and metabolic pathways. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",164
Page 93,"So it is the ability to metabolize carbs, not carbs themselves which is responsible for carb related health problems. If you ever went zero carb, you know the horrific withdrawals that carb restriction can lead to. Why is that? Well our body can not run efficiently without carbohydrates. Many people when they go zero carb find themselves experiencing panic attacks and even being unable to breathe for example as a result of chronic low carb dieting. This. Is. Not. Normal. And there’s no reason to be in ketosis for more than 4 weeks per year for 99.9999% of people and this even might be too much for some people. Of course, ketosis can be a great short term tool, but short term, not long term. Now the number 1 sign of suboptimal glucose metabolism is constant sugar cravings (this signs an inappropriate metabolism of carbs once they are digested). If one’s glucose metabolism is healthy, carb cravings do not occur often during the day since carbs are directed first toward storage as glycogen (which is designed to constantly release small amounts of glucose into the bloodstream between meals to sustain blood glucose levels) and then the production of energy. B vitamins are involved in the enzymatic processes which run cellular respiration, and a deficiency of the important ones can interrupt the process. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",281
Page 94,"Thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacinamide (B3) and biotin (B7), are all crucial for proper carb metabolism andwithout them the body revertsto anaerobic metabolism rather than aerobic (carbs are metabolized into lactic acid instead of CO2). There is a three part formula for replenishing these nutrients. First of all, a person must heal his gut (we cover this on optimizing thyroid performance and prioritize animal protein which is rich in B vitamins (given that he will not ignore the importance of balancing the amino acid profile and will add things such as bone marrow, bone broth and even grass fed collagen or glycine). Second of all, it might be useful to supplement with: 1) Magnesium glycinate (you can daily). 2) A small dose (⅓ of the recommended dose) of vitamin B2 if your gut is not in optimal condition or brewer’s yeast if it is 3 times a week. 3) Thiamine (3-6 times per week). 4)Niacinamide (3-5 times per week). 5)Biotin (3-5 times per week) for 2-4 weeks. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",264
Page 95,"Do not supplement B vitamins for more than 6 weeks, especially niacin, never supplement a B complex and never consume synthetic B6 (most of the time is just a cheap additive (reason why it is in so many soft drinks) that will damage your liver. B vitamins should be supplemented in the morning with a good meal and with post sunlight exposure. An important note also is that since B vitamins which must be consumed with carbs will increase the metabolic rate, you need to make sure you have enough vitamin A in your system so the biweekly 100 grams of beef liver should not be neglected. Third, he should get rid of the supplements and maintain proper amounts of vitamins and minerals through the proper diet (see lesson 2). The fourth priority for optimizing glucose metabolism is vitamin D levels. Vitamin D is technically a hormone. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",178
Page 96,"The symptoms of vitamin D deficiency vary from extreme fatigue , high blood pressure, mood swings , bone loss , insulin resistance , dry skin and low testosterone. Vitamin D can help someone : -Prevent autoimmune diseases -Prevent muscle waste -Improve steroid driven hair loss -Treat depression -Improve insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes -Improve low testosterone -Improve calcium absorption -Support the immune system -Fight allergies -Improve skin conditions Vitamin D3 is best created when UV light from the sun hits your skin. So sunlight is obviously important for vitamin D production, BUT this can get inhibited by 5 main things. Lack of cholesterol, lack of zinc, lack of B12, lack of electrolytes/minerals and lack of antioxidants. So by following the diet that this course promotes, should address these 5 factors as well. Depending on where you live, 30-120 minutes of sunlight exposure are enough in order to get enough vitamin D. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",200
Page 97,"If you however do not live in a sunny area, a) still go outside for the above time frame and b) consider red light therapy and vitamin D +K2 supplementation in liquid form with the additional pectin on a mealpriorof the supplementation. The fifth priority for optimizing glucose metabolism is the right amount of resistance training. Muscles use glucose at a phenomenal level (muscle tissue uses the vast majority of glucose). Resistance training for only 30 minutes for 3 times a week, has been shown to improve glucose tolerance and whole-body insulin sensitivity. Exercise-induced improvements in insulin sensitivity have also been linked to enhancements in metabolic pathways responsible for glucose utilization. Lifting and running have also long been established as an intervention to induce mitochondrial biogenesis in young individuals. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",168
Page 98,"The mitochondrial enzyme PDH is of interest due to its function in glucose oxidation and the fact that insulin-stimulated regulation has been reported to be diminished with age. But if your metabolic health is not optimal, please do not over do it. Your goal right now is health, not aesthetics. This means that lifting 4 days a week for 45 minutes by using compound movements, not going under the 5 rep range and taking long rest periods (3-7 minutes depending on the movement), will be more beneficial than lifting 7 days for 2 hours. In the second scenario, you will be producing way too much lactic acid in order for your metabolism to not take a hit. Also remember to use thiamine, coconut oil and everything else we discussed pre-workout in order to manage lactic acid production. Otherwise if your metabolic health is fine, simply pick your goal (muscle gain, fat loss, recomp), open to the specific file and choose your program. One more crucial nutrient for glucose metabolism is vitamin K2 since the pancreas has high levels of K2 and when K2 is deficient insulin resistance peaks. So a short term supplementation with even MK7 could be beneficial for optimizing glucose metabolism unless you have issues with your mast cells (this will be addressed in the gut healing part) and in that case you should stick to vitamin K2 sources such as beef liver, chicken liver and free range egg yolks. Vitamin K2 is also an electron carrier so it results in more efficient ATP production and mitochondrial health. High bioavailable sources of vitamin K2 are: -Raw dairy (especially cheeses and butter). -Beef liver -Chicken liver -Egg yolks ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",355
Page 99,"Make sure to have one of these vitamin K2 sources on your diet every day. Module 1.6: Optimizing thyroid performance There is one gland that governs our metabolism and that gland is our thyroid. The thyroid is a 2-inch-long gland which weighs less than 1 ounce and is located in the front of the neck below the larynx. It has two lobes, one on each side of the windpipe which leads to its “butterfly” shape. The thyroid is one of the glands that make up the endocrine system. The glands of the endocrine system produce and store hormones and release them into the bloodstream. The hormones then travel through the body and direct the activity of the body’s cells. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",164
Page 100,"Thyroid hormone is what regulates metabolism and without enough thyroid hormone, most of the body’s functions slow down. The thyroid gland makes two thyroid hormones: -Triiodothyronine (T3) and -Thyroxine (T4) T3 is made from T4 and is the more active hormone, directly affecting the tissues. When (inactive) T4 is released into the bloodstream, it goes to the liver and other organs to be converted into (active) T3. This conversion is known as deiodination of T4 and is a process which happens primarily within the liver and organs such as the kidneys and small intestines. This is the primary action of the thyroid and the second one is to regulate circulating calcium levels (by using calcitonin which regulates too much calcium) along with the parathyroid and its PTH (parathyroid hormone which regulates too little calcium). The thyroid gland directly communicates with the brain, the pituitary, the parathyroid, the pancreas, the liver, the adrenal glands and the intestinal system. Thyroid hormone production is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is made by the pituitary gland in the brain. When thyroid hormone levels in the blood are low, the pituitary releases more TSH (which raises LDL). When thyroid hormone levels are high, the pituitary responds by dropping TSH production. Hypothyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone to meet the body’s needs. There are 10 typical signs of suboptimal thyroid function and hence suboptimal metabolic function. These are: Sign #1: Chronic fatigue ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",361
Page 101,"Sign #2: Not being hungry in the morning Sign #3: Low body temperature and slowed heart rate Sign #4: Thinning hair ( which is very different than hair loss) Sign #5: Dry skin Sign #6: High LDL Sign #7: Insomnia Sign #8: Low libido Sign #9: Inability to put on muscle mass Sign #10: High prolactin If you are experiencing 3 or more of these, chances are that you have suboptimal metabolic function (don’t worry this is pretty common and reversible). A typical thyroid panel test would include: 1)TSH (1.0 – 2.5 μIU/mL) 2)Total T4 ( 6.0 – 11.9 mcg/dL) 3)Total T3 (100 – 168 ng/dL) 4)Reverse T3 (14.9 – 24.1 ng/dL) 5)Free T4 (1.0 – 1.5 ng/dL) 6)Free T3 (3.0 – 4.0 pg/mL) ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",236
Page 102,"7)Thyroid antibodies (0 – 15 IU/mL) Now in most cases hypothyroidism can be completely controlled with the right lifestyle changes and perhaps liothyronine (cytomel and triostat). I don’t recommend you start supplementing T3 since i find it ridiculous. These products are heavily overdosed and very few people actually need it. Also synthetic thyroxine which is what is prescribed in most cases (T4 instead of T3) tends to harm the liver even more. (I am not against it though if combined properly with T3 for the rare cases that need T3) A client's severe hypothyroidism got solved in 5 weeks. We're talking about a 345 anti-TPO, a 42.55 anti-tg and a 5.09 TSH. Everything got down to normal in 5 weeks. So reversing bad thyroid and metabolic function is do-able if a person understands the fundamentals of good metabolic health. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",213
Page 103,"Remember this pic we saw at the beginning of this lesson? Now imagine for a second that you have a fire. What does a fire need in order to keep burning? Wood, aka the right type of fuel. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",56
Page 104,"Just as a fire can use various objects so to speak in order to keep burning but its preferred fuel in order to burn wood which allows it to have the biggest fire possible with the least effort, the same thing implies for our metabolism. Our body can use suboptimal nutrition to fuel its fire (pop tarts and so on) but this will not lead to optimal metabolic function. Now, just as when you throw crap in a fire it creates more smoke, the same thing again implies for our metabolism. When we use poor nutrition as fuel, our metabolism will create a lot of “smoke” in the metabolic processes aka it will create a lot of harmful by-products. There is also one crucial point that we need to mention. One more reason we can harm a fire is by throwing too much fuel on it. You can put out a fire by throwing in too much wood and if you have ever done it you have noticed that it creates a ton of smoke. The same thing again implies for our bodies. It does not matter what your nutrition looks like. If you provide too much fuel, you will end up harming your metabolism and just as a fire will create a ton of smoke, so will our body (create a ton of toxic by products). So, in order to heal our metabolism we must first realize that as a fire needs the right fuel in the right amount, so does our metabolism. If you have ever put on a fire, you’ve noticed that it functions at its best when you throw in wood at a semi-regular rate. The same thing applies to our metabolism. We do not want the fire to almost burn out and then provide fuel in order to re-ignite it, what we want to do is first of all put on a descent fire, aka heal our glucose metabolism, the NAD+ pathway and everything we saw in the previous pages because that’s the mechanisms that our metabolism uses in order to burn wood. Second of all is to provide the right kind of fuel and third of all to slowly start adding fuel more frequently but as we said all these up to a point. Now, have you ever put on a fire by throwing HUGE junks of wood? ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",462
Page 105,"Of course you haven’t. You start by throwing in slim and small pieces of wood until you create a fire that can burn bigger ones and again bigger ones up to a point. Again, the same thing applies for our metabolism. So this is the simple metaphor that we will use in order to understand how our metabolism works. Now, most people, as we said, do not have an actual thyroid problem but a conversion problem. The active thyroid hormones are converted in small amounts on organs such as the small intestines and the kidneys and in large amounts on the liver (70-80%). So, the conversion problem is what needs to be addressed first in order to optimize thyroid performance. Which are the most common things that cause conversion problems and how can we address them? Number 1: Not enough thyroid supportive nutrients in the diet These are: 1)Copperwhich is required for the synthesis of thyroidhormones. Best sources of copper are beef liver and oysters. 2)Seleniumwhich is also required for the synthesisof thyroid hormones and a selenium deficiency usually leads to autoimmune thyroiditis. Best sources of selenium are: seafood, beef, chicken, turkey and brazil nuts (do not eat more than 3-5 per day). Note: some people don’t pay attention to vitamin Cwhen it comes to thyroid but vitamin C affects the entire endocrine system and also a deficiency affects selenium metabolism which will directly affect thyroid. 3)Zincwhich is required for the synthesis of thyroidhormones but also the function of T3 receptors. Zinc is one of the primary facilitators of proper thyroid function because zinc it a) is responsible for vitamin A activity b)the synthesis of thyroid hormone and c) it is involved in the pathways responsible for the recycling of vitamin C. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",382
Page 106,"Best sources of zinc are: oysters and beef. Which brings us to4) Vitamin C Vitamin C is the first defender when it comes to the protection of many vital organs (especially the heart) including the thyroid. Best sources of vitamin C are berries, camu camu, acerola cherry (personal favorite), pomegranates, grapefruit juice (no pulp) and orange juice (no pulp). 5)Vitamin A + B12which are required both for theproper utilization of thyroid hormones. Vitamin A regulates thyroid hormone metabolism and inhibits thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The best source for these 2 is beef liver. 6)Iodinewhich is required for the synthesis of thyroidhormones. The thyroid hormone itself is an iodine containing protein. We recycle a TON of iodine every day and you should NOT supplement iodine. The best sources for iodine are some seaweed every once in a while, cod and shrimp. 7)Vitamin D A deficiency of vitamin D will downregulate thyroid function. Optimal thyroid health can not be expected without enough vitamin D aka sun exposure. A minimum of one hour of direct sunlight exposure to skin each day after someone has built up to it, is necessary for the full functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis and stimulate the parts of the brain which would otherwise downregulate the metabolic rate. Sunlight is obviously the best source of vitamin D (if you have enough zinc and vitamin C in your system) but if you want to supplement vitamin D do not exceed 4.000IUs per day and a) use a liquid form b)also use a liquid form of K2 and c) make sure you have enough vitamin A in your system as we said. 8)Beta carotene Without pro-vitamin A, aka carotene the body cannot make or use thyroid hormone. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",399
Page 107,"Supplementing beta carotene is extremely dangerous and one should include foods such as pumpkin, squash, sweet potatoes, peaches and apricots on his diet. 9)Calcium In order to perform some vital daily functions, the body works to keep a steady amount of calcium in the blood and tissues. If calcium levels drop too low in the blood, parathyroid hormone (PTH) will signal the bones to release calcium into the bloodstream. At the same time, PTH signals the kidneys to release less calcium in the urine. When the body has enough calcium, a different hormone called calcitonin works to do the opposite: it lowers calcium levels in the blood by stopping the release of calcium from bones and signaling the kidneys to rid more of it in the urine. The best sources of calcium (make sure you get enough sunlight) are raw dairy, bone broth/marrow and eggshells. Number 2: Low carb diets. Carbohydrates are the most efficient source of energy we humans have access to and some cells in the body can only run on carbohydrates. The liver can function optimally only when there are sufficient energy stores of glycogen. If you go low carb for years, your thyroid will get destroyed since your liver won’t have enough glucose to convert T4 into T3 and since 70% of this conversion happens only in the liver you will experience hypothyroidism and suboptimal metabolic health. Low glycogen levels induce stress and this is the main reason why it will be impossible to get proper sleep on the carnivore diet (again, the carnivore diet does not include raw dairy) and your hair will fall out. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",350
Page 108,"Now, first of all, in order for the body to be able to utilize carbohydrates properly, one must restore glucose metabolism as we so prior on this course and do not neglect B vitamins or magnesium. This is crucial. Then he must focus on adding two specific carbohydrates. Number 1: Fruit. Fructose is the fastest way to replenish liver glycogen (by up to 300%) since fructose is the preferred fuel of the liver and as we said fructose does not require insulin to get into the cell. There is a detail though, for the first weeks of someone re-introducing fructose into his diet, he must focus first on high potassium fruits. Then after 4 weeks he can eat whatever local and seasonal fruit that he wants to. One sign of fatigued adrenals by the way (given that sodium levels are enough on one’s diet) is that a person has to urinate almost immediately after consuming a high potassium food or magnesium supplement. Number 2: Honey as God intended to be consumed aka honeycomb. Honeycomb has royal jelly (which will help men convert DHEA into testosterone faster), bee pollen, propolis and raw honey all at once. From fighting infections to improving heart health,honeycomb is a true superfood that should be consumed once or twice a week (don’t over do it) preferably post workout. Number 3: Gut issues Part of deiodination happens in the small intestines, so an unhealthy gut will directly affect our thyroid performance and our metabolism. This happens because thyroid hormone in a healthy gut reacts with acetic acid which activates it and transforms T4 into T3. If the gut is in a state of dysbiosis and producing very little acetic acid, T3 fails to activate and thus results in functional hypothyroidism (conversion problems). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",381
Page 109,"Gut health is the foundation of good health in general since every biological process depends on the gut. Food is first digested in the stomach and small (or upper) intestine where we absorb as much nutrient potential as possible to prevent competition with bacterial species further down, which consume the same nutrients as we do, and the remainder which we cannot metabolize is carried on to the farm in the lower intestine. A healthy gut springs from: 0) The proper stomach acid levels (HCL) and healthy digestive enzymes 1) Daily deep and restful sleep which we addressed in detail. 2) Daily sunlight exposure and the proper vitamin D levels which we addressed. 3) Movement 4) Addressing bacterial overgrowth 5) Addressing deficiencies 6) Hydrating the right way So let’s see these one by one. On stomach acid and digestive enzymes We will start with stomach acid since this is the number 1 cause for the most common digestive issues (heartburn being one of them which is not caused by too much stomach acid). The typical signs of low stomach acid production are: •Bloating •Fatigue •Brain fog •Gas after a meal •Leaky gut •Low B12 levels ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",253
Page 110,"•Undigested food in stool •Heartburn Stomach acid production is first of all dependent on the amount of animal protein and sea salt that’s coming from one’s diet since HCL consists of hydrogen and chloride. Hydrogen is found in meat and chloride is found in sea salt. Besides this, animal protein is high in zinc and B vitamins which are used up by the stomach cells to produce HCL. Now there are three main problems with B vitamins. The first one is that they are depleted very easily especially when someone is under stress or fasting chronically. The second one is that 80% of the population (in the US) is estimated to suffer from some form of candida, SIBO or H.pylori which all deplete B vitamins. The third and last problem is that they are extremely sensitive to heat and since in the modern world we tend to overcook everything, we further decrease the amount of B vitamins in foods. So the first step in order to make sure we will not face low stomach acid issues is to have a diet which includes: 1.Some raw free range egg yolks (not whites, raw egg whites destroy our stomach and deplete us of biotin). The key word is “some”. You don’t want your entire diet to be made out of raw foods. After a certain point, raw animal foods will not heal your gut but destroy it by feeding pathogenic bacteria. 2.Some raw oysters or shellfish if oysters are not possible. 3.Medium cooked red meat (you can try stuff such as tartare as well once in a while) balanced with bone marrow on the side. and 4.Sea salt (not himalayan pink salt (it is fortified with inorganic iron which we discuss in detail later) or any other type of salt). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",390
Page 111,"Salt is important for so many things besides HCL production such as : 1.Protein and carbohydrate digestion 2.Development of the brain 3.Cellular metabolism 4.Adrenal function 5.Blood volume regulation. The second step of gut healing is addressing B12 in specific. Besides stomach acid secretion, other substances like intrinsic factor (IF) are also secreted in the lining of the stomach. This IF has its use in absorbing vitaminB12furtherdown in the small intestine. I usually suggest 2 strategies for fixing B12 deficiency in people who also want to heal their gut. Strategy 1: 30-60 grams of organic beef liver 3 times a week for 2-3 weeks straight and then 200 grams every 7-10 days. The“organic”part is important. The beef liver youwill find in most supermarkets will 100% damage your health through excess iron and heavy metals. If you can find liver from a local small farm though, this can usually be a good replacement as well. Just make sure to spice it up with some turmeric and black pepper in order to prevent some iron from being absorbed and since you will not be consuming liver daily, you will not have to worry about turmeric lowering your DHT. Strategy 2: Supplementing with 500μg of B12 every other day for 10 days and then 2 times a week. I think that short term supplementation will actually help a lot of people. Just do not over consume B12 (the 1000μg dose most B12 supplements contain is too much for most people). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",328
Page 112,"Now when it comes to zinc, the right amount of zinc is critical to intestinal health. For example, daily supplementary therapy with 75 mg elemental zinc has been shown to cause a significant reduction in the increased intestinal permeability of CD patients in clinical remission. But zinc supplementation should always be a short term insurance policy and not something standar (very few supplements should be a standard in one’s nutrition plan to begin with). Zinc is a mineral so crucial for our gut health that when we consume too little of it the intestinal barrier literally falls apart. So it’s no wonder why people with a zinc deficiency experience gut problems and serious ones. Zinc supplement can also be a problem long term since zinc depletes manganese very fast. In nature, every food that’s high in zinc is high in B vitamins or selenium as well and this prevents manganese from being depleted. This is of course not the case for supplements and this is one more reason why we should avoid them long term. Stomach acid, enzymes and chewing speed. Another thing that is crucial for a healthy gut is the proper eating speed and chewing your food. Chewing stimulates stomach acid and digestive enzymes. So if you are already facing problems with low stomach acid, not chewing your food is causing you way more harm than you might think. So try to eat as slow as you can in order to help digestive enzymes. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",301
Page 113,"This step is crucial but very often neglected and without the proper chewing speed, recovering from low stomach acid production can take a very long time. Note: If you are a fast compulsive eater by the way, chances are that you’re facing some kind of microbial overgrowth (main cause low stomach acid) and you should add in your diet blackseed oil and other antimicrobial things such as oregano oil which we will later mention. Stomach acid production is dependent on zinc and B vitamins as we said, so a deficiency in these which is very common can also cause a deficiency in stomach acid. Any diet plan in this program will take care of both and if you want to supplement B vitamins, re-read the previous module. Side note: Common symptoms of a B vitamin deficiency are: 1)Chronic fatigue 2)Inability to concentrate 3)Sensitivity to sunlight (skin, not retina) 4)IBS 5)Insomnia 6)Epilepsy 7)Thinning hair (different than hair loss) 8)Dermatitis 9)High PTH + LDL 10)Anemia 11)Migraines 12)Apathy Other things that cause low stomach acid and you should avoid are: • Food additives • Artificial sweeteners • PUFAs • Grains • Legumes • Alcohol • Caffeine ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",284
Page 114,"• Poor quality dairy • NSAIDs • Tap water • Oxalates • Phytoestrogens • Nuts and seeds • Not the proper carb:protein:fat ratio for the individual’s blood type • A ton of supplements • Plastic/BPA • Not enough bioavailable calcium • A deficiency in fat soluble vitamins and not enough dietary cholesterol • Poor sleep • Excessive serotonin So let’s analyze these now. 1)Food additives Food additives are chemicals added to foods to keep them fresh or to enhance their color, flavor and texture. They can include things like: -Anti-caking agents (they stop ingredients from becoming lumpy). -Antioxidants (they prevent foods from oxidizing/going rancid). -Artificial sweeteners (increase the sweetness). -Emulsifiers (stop fats from clotting together). -Food acids (they maintain the right acid level). -Colors (they enhance/add color). -Humectants (they keep foods moist). -Flavors and flavor enhancers. -Foaming agents (they maintain uniform aeration of gasses in foods). -Preservatives (they stop microbes from multiplying and spoiling the food). -Thickeners and vegetable gums (they enhance texture and consistency). -Stabilizers and firming agents (they maintain even food dispersion). -Raising agents (they increase the volume of food through the use of gasses). -Bulking agents (they increase the volume of food without major changes to its available energy). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",325
Page 115,"And many other things (MSG etc) Some food additives can be safe in moderation but there are big problems with things like : artificial sweeteners (worse than GMO sugar), preservatives (food is supposed to rot within a few days), colors, thickeners, bulking agents and vegetable gums. So you must avoid most foods that come in a package, all soft drinks and deli meats. 2)Artificial sweeteners Now artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose , saccharin, stevia etc are destroying our gut (*), our liver (**)and lead to wild food cravings down the road. (*) Artificial sweeteners pass through the human GI tract without being digested so they come in direct contact with microbes in the colon resulting in making previously healthy gut bacteria to become diseased and invade the gut wall (anyone who has any gut/intestinal issues should stop consuming artificial sweeteners immediately). Artificial sweeteners can also cause glucose intolerance way faster than GMO sugar a lot of times. And anyone who might struggle with cancer should immediately stop consuming artificial sweeteners since they have been shown to increase the size of cancerous tumors. Researchers have called aspartame “a multi potent carcinogenic compound” and have pointed to the many dangers of artificial sweeteners. Artificial sweeteners in some cases can also trigger irritable bowel syndrome and crohn’s disease in susceptible patients. (**) Studies have shown that increased consumption of artificial sweeteners (especially in soft drinks) leads to lipid (fat) accumulation in the liver, fibrosis, and degeneration of the liver. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",344
Page 116,"3)PUFAs PUFAs coming from things such as canola oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil and so on, mess with your digestion in a very unique way. They literally destroy our bodies ability to digest food. PUFAs break down into toxic byproducts like HNE, acrolein and MDA when oxidized (*) resulting in heart attacks , cancer, Alzheimer's , diabetes and they damage metabolic function (partly by remodeling the cardiolipin structure of the mitochondria) and cause cellular death and leakage of potassium. (*)Unsaturated fats are more reactive to oxygen since they lack hydrogen atoms (leading to oxidative stress and disease). Oxidized PUFA can be dangerous when in our bodies, especially since oxidative damage to fat-containing LDL particles is a primary factor in the development of heart disease. And an omega-6 rich diet greatly increases oxidized LDL levels. The more PUFA we eat, the more that accumulates in our bodies' adipose tissue. So they age you, increase estrogen ( a MAJOR cause for acne and gut issues) and other stress hormones (which are the primary drive of cancer (cancer cells also are known to have very high levels of unsaturated fat and when a diet is rich in unsaturated fats, tumors grow very rapidly) and since every cell in your body needs “fat” (every cell membrane is made out of fat/cholesterol), when you’re not consuming saturated fats but unsaturated fats, your cell membranes will be made out of these poisons and you’ll have suboptimal protection against harmful everyday compounds. So it is best that your fat sources include only things such as: coconut oil, EVOO (extra virgin olive oil but not for cooking), palm kernel oil (not for cooking), avocados, some raw dairy after you’ve healed your gut, grass fed animal fats and in general things that do not need to be processed with petroleum based chemicals and are high in unsaturated fats. 4)Grains In modern agriculture, grains are probably the number 2 (soy is probably the number 1) thing that is sprayed with enormous amounts of herbicides such as glyphosate. A herbicide linked to cancer and which also leads to environmental catastrophes by destroying bee populations. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",483
Page 117,"Glyphosate was introduced to the marketplace in 1974 but data on its use is only available since 1990. Monsanto has genetically modified foods so that they are resistant to glyphosate, a herbicide Monsanto sells, resulting in a dramatic increase in the use of glyphosate. The study points out that research has shown that ""glyphosate disrupts the ability of animals, including humans, to detoxify xenobiotics. This means that exposure to the chemicals in food and the environment, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals and carcinogens, could be causing levels of damage that would not occur if the body were able to detoxify them. Modern grains destroy people’s guts and brains. There is zero doubt about it. 99.999% of people who go gluten free experience positive health benefits. Also most of the modern grains have been through excessive hybridization which ends up making gluten very very hard to digest compared to pre hybridized grains such as einkorn for example. That’s the whole problem with gluten. That the gluten that’s coming from modern wheat has nothing to do with the gluten we’ve been eating for thousands of years. Grains are also high in mycotoxins such as ochratoxin anddeoxynivalenol. The effects of mycotoxins on human health can be both acute and chronic, provoking problems such as liver cancer and respiratory problems. Mycotoxins cause pesturbation in the gut, particularly in the intestinal epithelial. Most of the reported effects of mycotoxins on human health are negative both short term and long term. Grains are also high in phytic acid which impairs the body's absorption of iron, zinc, and calcium and can contribute to a lot of mineral deficiencies over time. Glyphosate also holds on things like manganese, magnesium and minerals in general to the point of starving the plant itself. So a) the nutrient content of the plant is low to begin with and b) the phytic acid lowers your body’s storage of ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",430
Page 118,"nutrients (unless the plant is cooked in animal fats but still it only works in a sufficient level only with green leafy greens). 5)Legumes Legumes usually contain large amounts of lectins, phytic acid, phytoestrogens, cyanogenic glucosides (which interfere with iodine absorption and metabolism) , isoflavones , and soluble fiber which in large doses can harm the liver. Legumes also are high in protease inhibitors. Proteases are enzymes that break down proteins. So protease inhibitors are molecules that stop proteases from doing their job and thus legumes should be avoided for at least 12 weeks. 6)Alcohol Alcohol damages the stomach and intestinal lining in a really disastrous way. A person can not expect to heal his gut while drinking alcohol. Most alcoholic drinks are also fermented and thus contain a certain form of yeast that you should stay away from. In your case i suggest cutting back to drinking once a week instead of two times. 7)Tap water Tap water contains chlorine, sodium fluoride, microplastics, pesticides, herbicides, atrazine and could even contain things such as heavy metals, rust, birth control pills and antidepressants. So filtering your water is crucial in order to heal your gut. 8)Phytoestrogens Phytoestrogens are present in certain edible plants being most abundant in soy, they are structurally and functionally analogous to the estrogen and have also been classified as endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with endocrine (or hormone) systems at certain doses. These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and other developmental disorders. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",349
Page 119,"Phytoestrogens can manipulate steroid biosynthesis and transport by for example stimulating SHBG synthesis in liver cells, and displacing either 17β-estradiol or testosterone from plasma SHBG. This deflection of the quantity or availability of SHBG by phytoestrogens changes the free fraction of endogenous hormones in circulation systemically or locally. Even though some studies (some of them good and some of them bad) have shown some benefits for women, it is better to avoid phytoestrogens for men and also for anyone who is under 21 since some studies have shown increased infertility. What you should avoid most : - Soy/Soy products - Flax - Tempeh - Sesame seeds - Beer 9)Oxalates Oxalic acid is mostly (a lot of grains also contain oxalates) found in leafy greens, nuts, seeds and night shades and our concern with it here is that it inhibits calcium absorption by binding it, so since most people with gut issues have not enough bioavailable calcium to begin with, they should be avoided for 12 weeks and then consumed only slow cooked in quality animal fats since things such as organic spinach cooked in tallow for example, can be beneficial once in a while. 10)Phytates Phytic acid plays a role in the development of a plant as a phosphorus store. It is found in spinach, lentils, legumes, beans,nuts, peanuts, all kinds of seeds, grains, oats, rice and corn. Phytates block the absorption of the nutrients that the plants store, which is the basic principle of an antinutrient. 11)Dairy products ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",349
Page 120,"Dairy products when the quality is high are probably the most nutritious foods on the planet but people with gut issues should take a break from them. The amount of carnivores that promoted dairy products to their friends with gut issues to the point of them taking literally 4X the time to heal is ridiculous. Not to mention pasteurized milk and BCM-7 (an opioid peptide which is released in order for pasteurized dairy to be digested). Obviously also, a lot of people have dairy intolerances or even allergies and this should also not be ignored. An 8 week break from all dairy products while fixing HCL and B12 levels are crucial in order for someone to be able to properly digest and utilize dairy. 12)Fasting Taking a break from the wrong kind of foods is, of course, beneficial. But since we are talking about optimizing one’s stomach acid, fasting can be counterproductive since our gut needs stimuli in order to produce enough stomach acid and that stimuli is of course the right kind of food. When trying to heal the gut, 3 easy digestible meals a day and perhaps a snack on the weightlifting days seem to be the ideal number so stick to the meal plan that will be presented. 13)A ton of supplements It is not uncommon for people in health spaces to consume 30 different supplements a day, not to mention things such as pre workouts, testosterone boosters, pump enhancers and so on. The problem with this is that most of them contain microplastics, silicone derivatives, soy lecithin and so on and are a burden on the liver as well. 50-70% of the supplements out there are not worth it. The ones that are worth it, should be nothing more than specific tools which as a result should be used under the right circumstances. 14)Plastic/BPA Plastic slips in everything nowadays. The average person consumes a credit card every week in microplastics. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",403
Page 121,"Plastic also contains phthalates which areassociated with increased prenatal mortality, reduced growth and birth weight. Some plastic products also contain benzophenones but these are a bigger threat in personal care products since they come in direct contact with our skin. Note: some product’s labels might say “BPA free” but most of them include BPS which you should also avoid. Just say no to plastic as much as possible. It’s good for the environment too. Avoid eating and drinking out of plastic containers in order to heal your gut (but health as well). Also, one more cause for low stomach acid since we are kind of talking about xenoestrogens, is toothpastes and mouthwashes since they destroy the mouth's PH. So sticking to toothpastes made out of natural ingredients and ditching mouthwash for coconut oil, will be very beneficial. 15)Excessive serotonin There are many ways to get rid of excessive serotonin but not many if your gut health is not optimal. Here are the safest ways to get rid of excessive serotonin if your gut health is not optimal. 1) Glycine Glycine mitigates the excessive tryptophan (a serotonin agonist) that comes from a lot of animal products and basically aids serotonin clearance. 2) Another one is supplementing ginkgo biloba(notwith niacin) which can normalize elevated catecholamine and lowers serotonin since it has opposite effects of serotonin (it increases blood flow to the brain (serotonin reduces it)). 3) 2-4 free range whole eggs a day for the choline benefits. Choline increases dopamine receptor densities and can even ameliorate memory impairment. 4) Do not fast. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",368
Page 122,"Dopamine deficiency which can affect serotonin excess sometimes occurs when people are extremely stressed because adrenaline is actually made from dopamine. If you’re a fasting maniac, you’re obviously pumping adrenaline like a maniac and this should be avoided. 5)Eat a macronutrient balanced dinner. At night when we are asleep adrenaline is expressed in order to release glycogen from tissue storage to keep our organs and metabolism running. If you don’t have any food in your system the adrenaline will lead to all shorts of messes which will result in again, dopamine deficiency. 6)Mandatory weekly oysters. A promoter of adrenaline excess is zinc deficiency. So never forget to eat your weekly serving of oysters. 7)Get on thiamine (B1). Most people are thiamine deficient (both due to the lack of dietary thiamine but also a compromised gut) and a deficiency in thiamine increases serotonin production. A note on sunlight and vitamin D Vitamin D levels are crucial for gut health and many people’s gut issues do not resolve because they leave vitamin D unaddressed. Vitamin D influences gut function and lining and is needed to make antimicrobial peptides and is shown to be protective against numerous infections and diseases like parasitic overgrowth. Supplementing vitamin D (in a liquid form) even though it can be very very beneficial especially for people who have taken lots of antibiotics in their life (antibiotics mess up some of the enzymes that help vitamin D from being absorbed in the gut and a solution for this is to start adding some pectins in the diet), can not substitute sunlight. A common cause for gut issues in general but also bacterial overgrowth in specific, is unbound iron. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",365
Page 123,"Unbound iron results in all sorts of trouble when it comes to gut health. It not only feeds very effectively pathogenic species but it also kills beneficial ones. Some pathogenic species can also only feed on iron. The biggest heavy metal issue we face today is unbound iron. Most people today consume way too many PUFAs and their iron homeostasis is far from optimal. This results in a lot of oxidative stress and thus metabolic problems. Copper, vitamin C and vitamin E are the main regulators of iron homeostasis. If you are not a child you need very little iron to maintain health and obviously not the kind of raw metal shavings which are added to iron fortified foods such as common wheat. Unbound iron can destroy your entire metabolism (and thus cause cancer, Alzheimer’s and many other diseases) like nothing else. Iron is highly unstable unless properly bound and buffered by some specific proteins such as lactoferrin. To put it simply the problem is not iron itself exactly but when it's present in its free form because due to its ability to participate in redox reactions, iron is a catalyst for the formation of hydroxyl radicals from reduced forms of O2. Reducing excess iron will help someone with all sorts of niche health areas such as heal cancer, hair-loss, acne, eczema, insomnia, ED, chronic fatigue and so on. Unbound iron contributes to illnesses through the promotion of bacteria and viruses which need iron in order to replicate. This alters our microbiota and feeds pathogenic species of bacteria which excrete toxic compounds that destroy our internal organs. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",338
Page 124,"Surprisingly, one of the most common causes of bloating when consuming grains is not gluten (which i am not a fun of in hybridized grains but more about this in lesson 2), but the iron that they fortify the cereals with. But what about anemia? Doesn’t an anemic person need to consume more iron? The short answer is no. Anemia in 99% of the cases is not actually caused by a lack of iron in the diet but a deficit of the vitamins and nutrients which are involved in the metabolism of iron with the most common ones being vitamin A, vitamin D, biotin and vitamin C which is required to keep iron in a biologically soluble state. What can we do about unbound iron? First of all be patient since regulating iron homeostasis can take up to a year and this illustrates that iron homeostasis is not something to be taken lightly. Step 1: Stop consuming iron fortified foods (avoid all grains) and stop consuming foods extremely high in iron for 3 months. Step 2: Add blackseed oil in your diet since it is the only natural antibiotic that will not harm the friendly bacteria. Antibiotics are useful under this context since they bind to iron preventing it being used by bacteria. This will also help you with any candida overgrowth you might be facing. Step 3: Start adding in your diet the following foods: pineapple, carrots, squash, pumpkin and cooked garlic/onions/broccoli since sulfur strongly binds to excess iron. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",318
Page 125,"Step 4: Start adding turmeric and black pepper to meats that are high in iron once in a while. Step 5: Consider supplementing with 200-500mg of vitamin C that is coming from whole foods and 50-100mg of thiamine for up to 4 weeks 3-5 days of the week, since both of these is crucial for iron regulation and the excretion of any extra iron through the skin and urine (if you have too much unbound iron and supplement thiamine, you might find that you smell bad after about 45-90 minutes of consuming it (the same implies with things such as onions and if you break out (not in hives, a couple of pimples) when you consume onions or thiamine, you have a lot of unbound iron). Vitamin C will help remove iron that is stored in the tissues and prevent it from oxidizing. Step 6: The weekly oysters should take care of any zinc deficiency that might be present and cause an iron excess. Step 7: Consider supplementing a low dose of riboflavin (B2) since it can prevent pathogenic bacteria from using iron. Step 8: Biweekly beef liver since vitamin A stimulates the release of iron that is stored in the tissues. Step 9: No alcohol for 4-12 weeks since alcohol stimulates the increased uptake of iron by tissues. On movement First of all, movement matters for digestion because it stimulates gastric fluids. If you have trouble digesting your food, besides removing the wrong things from your diet and adding the right ones, a 5-15 minute walk post meal can severely help your digestion. According to WHO 60 to 85% of people in the world live sedentary lifestyles. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",360
Page 126,"The problems with physical inactivity don’t stop at digestion. Physical inactivity is one of the leading causes of disease and disability. Sedentary lifestyles increaseall causes of mortality.They double the risk of cardiovascular diseases , lipid disorders , depression , anxiety , Alzheimer’s , diabetes and obesity. Approximately 2 million deaths per year are attributed to physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle could be among the 10 leading causes of death and disability. Physical inactivity, along with the increased consumption of many poisons are leading to the rapid rise of many diseases. Most people today live sedentary lives. Even the gym bros. You are not meant to pump iron for 45 minutes and sit on a desk for the rest of the day. It’s unnatural. And when humans live an unnatural life , all sorts of problems begin to arise. This is the reason why besides lifting weights you should aim for 10-15K steps a day and you will see that your digestion will greatly benefit from it. Walking daily WILL help you: maintain a healthy weight, lose body fat, prevent or manage various conditions, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, cancer and type 2 diabetes, improve cardiovascular fitness, strengthen your bones and muscles, it has a profound antidepressant effect, improve muscle endurance, increase energy levels, improve your mood, cognition, memory and sleep, improve your balance and coordination, strengthen immune system and reduce stress and tension.

Page 127,"Addressing pathogens, SIBO and candida the right way Histamine and bacteria overgrowth Most approaches when it comes to addressing bacteria overgrowth fail for a variety of reasons but one very common is that they do not address histamine and mast cells. Not only that, but a lot of times when people blame things such as a flaky scalp on candida for example, they fail to understand that the underlying cause could very possibly be a histamine reaction. Otherwise why do a good portion of the people who supplement flush niacin (niacin supplementation is a complicated topic that will be addressed later), experience severe flaky and dry skin on their scalp even within minutes of supplementing niacin? This is for example also why many people’s guts have such horrific reactions when it comes to eating foods such as spinach. Spinach, if it’s slow cooked in animal fats and is not overconsumed, can actually greatly help a lot of people’s gut since vitamin K will address the excessive oxygen in the gut that things such as unbound iron can create. The problem is not spinach per say, the problem is that spinach is very very high in histamines. Histamine is a molecule produced in our bodies by decarboxylation of the amino acid histidine. It is distributed throughout all tissues but it is particularly concentrated in the skin. lungs and GI tract. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",297
Page 128,"Histamine is generated and stored within granules in mast cells (*) located within the tissues basophils and eosinophils circulating in the blood and enterochromaffin-like cells located in the stomach lining. (*)A mast cell is a type of white blood cell and is found in connective tissues throughout your body. Mast cells help your immune system function properly and normally help protect us from disease. Mast cells are key components in the inflammatory response as they can be activated to release a wide variety of inflammatory mediators, by many different antigens including allergens, pathogens and physiological mediators. Mast cells synthesize and secrete histamine, proteases,prostaglandin D2, leukotrienes, heparin and a variety of cytokines. Mast cells play an important role in how the immune system responds to certain bacteria and parasites and they help control other types of immune responses. Histamine intolerance (something very common in people with skin and gut issues) is a condition in which your body cannot degrade high amounts of histamine due to inadequate levels of enzymes called diamine oxidase. Histamine intolerance can also cause sleep problems, thyroid issues and hair loss besides gut and skin issues. Histamine intolerance is not something that you have to carry around for a lifetime in case we are not talking about serious allergies. But why do we care about histamines when it comes to gut health? It’s because bacteria produce histamines. Bacteria are able to synthesize and secrete histamine so if you increase the histamine responses through diet and lifestyle, you will be feeding these bacteria without even knowing it. So the first step is to minimize the histamine response. Here’s how we are going to do this. Step 1: Avoid all of the following foods for 4-12 weeks ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",387
Page 129,"1) No kefir 2) No cheeses (especially parmesan) 3) No canned foods 4) No chocolate 5) No soy 6) No nuts 7) No mustard 8) No tomatoes 9) No cured meats 10) No dried fruit 11) No preservatives 12) No additives 13) No bananas 14) No yogurt 15) No kimchi 16) No kombucha 17) No coffee 18) No vinegar, (especially the ones with the mother) 19) No sourdough 20) No alcohol. Also avoid too much olive oil. Step 2: Also avoid histamine liberators(*) such as cabbage and too much stress. (*)Histamine liberators are things that trigger the release of the body's existing histamine. Do your best to minimize stress since the more cortisol you have,the more histamine reaction you have. Note:This is why antihistamines make a lot of people sleepy and make them sleep a lot. It’s because they were running on cortisol and adrenaline. Step 3: Only eat freshly cooked meals. When foods sit, the bacteria break down histidine into histamine. Step 4: Add foods that stabilize mast cells (how antihistamine drugs work). These include: ●Chamomile ●Turmeric ●Ginger ●Apples (skin off in order to avoid the pesticides and herbicides) ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",293
Page 130,"●Peaches (skin off) Step 5: Add mast cell inhibitors The best natural solutions are : 1)Quercetin Quercetin inhibits the mast cells and stabilizes cortisol. Quercetin is fat soluble so you’ll need to consume it with a fatty meal in order to increase the absorption. Quercetin has a half life of 2 hours, so after the first 2 days that you’ll take it once in order to see if you have some negative reaction to it, you’re going to up it to 3 times a day. Note: Yes, low levels of zinc can lead to a histamine intolerance since the zinc chelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) inhibits the release of histamine, the production of cytokines, and the secretion of lipid mediators in mast cells but remember what we said about zinc supplements. 2)A teaspoon of black cumin seed oil 2 times a day with meals. Black cumin seed oil has great antihistamine effects and is one of the most studied natural remedies that has been utilized for its medicinal properties for over two thousand years. Blackseed oil is superior to all other natural anti microbiotics for one more reason. When things such as oregano oil wipe out all pathogenic microorganisms (this includes the good strains of bacteria as well), black cumin seed oil attacks the pathogenic and spoilage bacteria but not good strains such as lactobacillus. Addressing SIBO SIBO or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is a condition that marks an abundance of bad bacteria in the small intestine causing bloating and all kinds of digestive distress besides malabsorption of nutrients. Tips to beat SIBO Go and test your vitamin B12 levels, if they are not very high and you experience a lot of fatigue, supplement a small dose (250μγ) of B12 every other day for even up to 4 weeks since a B12 deficiency is probably the most influential cause of SIBO. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",440
Page 131,"Your diet can only include: coconut oil, EVOO, blackseed oil, free range eggs, meat, sea salt, some turmeric, black pepper, white fish, organ meats, low GI fruits, some bone marrow or grass fed gelatin and some bone broth rice. You can supplement with now food’s candida support (it’s a good supplement for SIBO also) 3-5 days a week for a couple of weeks. Then take a 1-2 week mandatory break. Binders such as apple pectin and activated charcoal will also help you. Also do not even think about training in a fasted state since it will increase gut permeability and allow endotoxins to enter into the circulation. In the case of SIBO, taking digestive enzymes with meals can help you as well. Mastic gum can also be a good tool but do not start with it. Short term thiamine supplementation (with some fruit) can also greatly help since thiamine stimulates the oxidation of carbohydrate for energy which results in the production of CO2 which in turn binds and detoxifies ammonia. Zinc and C02 also become depleted by high levels of ammonia so always keep fruit and oysters in your diet. B3 supplementation, performed the way that you will read later in this lesson, is also a very powerful tool for SIBO. Note: Eating quality intestines will of course also help you heal intestines in case you can find quality ones. Obviously, cook the intestines. Candida Candida overgrowth is a yeast infection that usually leads to digestive and skin problems besides the typical intense brain fog. You should eliminate grains, PUFAs, sugar, artificial sweeteners, fermented foods, ALL dairy products and you should basically do a: meat, eggs, (some) white fish, low GI fruit, you can have in moderation some types of honey such as raw honey and manuka honey formethylglyoxal (an antibacterialcompound), blackseed oil, avocado, coconut oil, (some) organ meats and (some) rice. Iodine supplementation can be helpful but very tricky and as always start with a very very small amount of any supplement and never forget that they are short term tools which if you use long term, you will face problems. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",478
Page 132,"We cycle a lot of iodine and you should never supplement iodine daily or for months at a time. In both cases (sibo and candida) address unbound iron as you will see in the heavy metal detox part. Bacteria also require sufficient environmental methionine to grow, this means that after you have taken a break from any foods that might be triggering histamine for a few weeks, adding bone marrow, grass fed gelatin and glycine, could greatly help you heal your gut. Candida also can harvest calcium from food or even our tissues to buffer itself against things like histatin as well as stomach acid. In order to improve this problem, plenty of sunshine, vitamins K1, K2 and B12 (from whole foods, the supplementation must always be short term) are crucial. Now it is worth mentioning that some people with candida have benefited from raw almonds. I’m against most (unsprouted nuts), but you can try to eat 7 almonds (no more) a day for a week and see if it helps you. And again, short term thiamine supplementation (with some fruit) can also help since thiamine stimulates the oxidation of carbohydrate for energy which results in the production of CO2 which in turn binds and detoxifies ammonia. After you’ve implemented what we’ve discussed so far, you can also greatly benefit from taking apple pectin every once in a while (2-3 days per week). Since apple pectin cannot be metabolized into lactic acid, it is a very effective tool to promote metabolic health in general and it also helps the absorption of magnesium and lower excess histamine. The best way to take apple pectin is 20-40 minutes before a meal. It takes 2-5 weeks to get noticeable benefits from apple pectin* Hydrating the proper way (cellular hydration) Being hydrated is one of the key components of gut mobility. There’s more to hydration than ""drinking a gallon of water a day"" or any similar advice that can be counterproductive most of the time since too much water will dissolve minerals, dehydrate us and will dilute stomach acid. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",458
Page 133,"Cellular hydration is a term which refers to how much water reaches and is utilized by your cells. Being properly hydrated is crucial for every aspect of our health. Take free radicals for example. An atom or group of atoms with an unpaired electron is called a free radical. It can steal electrons from a stable molecule, creating a new free radical and initiating a chain reaction. This electron-grabbing is called oxidation and can set up a chain reaction, creating new free radicals and damaging important molecules along the way. Now if we are properly hydrated, the hydrogen in water will deactivate free radicals and clear them from our system. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",142
Page 134,"Many studies have also found that people who drank hydrogen-rich water saw a 39% increase in their antioxidant ability. Note: Can we measure our cellular hydration levels? Yes, we can through a BIA (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis) machine which measures how well our body's cells transmit electrical signals. A good reading will be anything from 8 and over. Now let's see how to properly hydrate yourselves. First we have electrolytes. Without the proper amount of electrolytes, water will not be absorbed by the cells but linger between the walls of the cells. Electrolytes dissolve in water and give it the ability to conduct electricity. The most important electrolytes are: 1)Sodium 2)Chloride ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",161
Page 135,"3)Potassium 4)Magnesium 5)Calcium We want to make sure we have enough electrolytes in our system so our cells can communicate electrically with each other. Good sources of the above mentioned electrolytes that you can start with are: -Coconut water -Sea salt -Magnesium both orally (not oxide) and topically -Eggshell powder -Raw milk Now you've probably heard that 90% of people are deficient in magnesium, but have you heard that 97% of people are deficient in potassium? ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",121
Page 136,"Yes, 97% so please start adding the above foods into your diet. Then manage your nnEMF exposure which all interfere with our cells natural electrical currents (you can also search how they loosen the cells' junctions). The most common sources of nnEMF are: -WiFi -Cell phones -Radio towers -Wireless electronic devices So grounding will help with cellular hydration as well. Of course, filtering your drinking and showering water is also crucial. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",109
Page 137,"Tap water contains birth control pills, sodium fluoride, pesticides, herbicides, chlorine, chloramine. You name it. It's the ultimate endocrine disruptor cocktail and must be avoided. An underrated hydration tool is optimizing one's glucose metabolism since when excess glucose builds up in our blood it will be excreted into our urine which will deplete fluids from our tissues (reason why diabetics are so thirsty). Number 4: Harmed NAD+ homeostasis. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its metabolites, function as regulators to enable the plastic cells to adapt to environmental changes including nutrient perturbation, genotoxic factors, circadian disorder, infection, inflammation and xenobiotics as we said prior. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and related coenzymes play critical roles in liver function. NAD+ metabolism controls the redox homeostasis. Imagine that NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H represents the switching hub that controls prooxidant-antioxidant balance and determines redox biology. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",235
Page 138,"The redox status can be defined as the balance between oxidants (or pro-oxidants) and antioxidants. Oxidants, including free radicals and other reactive species, are continuously produced in the cell. As it is impossible to completely prevent oxidant production, several antioxidant systems have evolved in the cell. Cells continuously generate oxidants and produce antioxidants. In order to maintain a healthy status, oxidants and antioxidants should be in equilibrium. However, this equilibrium is very difficult to maintain in the cell. When this equilibrium between oxidant and antioxidant is disrupted, tilting the equilibrium toward an oxidized state, oxidative stress is produced. Oxidative stress is involved in the physiopathology of several diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and many others. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",169
Page 139,"Oxidative stress compounds conversion problems and hypothyroidism is in general a state of increased oxidative stress. The way to address this is to optimize NAD+ homeostasis and support glutathione. If someone has read and implemented what we have discussed so far, NAD+ homeostasis is already in the rehab process and the only thing someone needs to do extra is pay more attention to targeted niacinamide supplementation. B vitamins make all the enzymatic and energetic processes that govern the creation and direction of energy. Niacin is the most important B vitamin for this process (if B1 for example is responsible for let’s say 25-35% of this process, niacin is responsible for 35-50%) because it is a NAD precursor. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",170
Page 140,"In mammals, NAD+ is synthesized from four precursors: tryptophan, nicotinic acid (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid), nicotinamide (nicotinic acid amide), nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). Without these, NAD+ homeostasis is impossible and since NAD’s function in the body is to shuttle electrons from processes which obtain energy from food to those which then use that energy, an optimal metabolism will be impossible to obtain as well which means that we are talking now about increased chances of serious metabolic diseases such as cancer since without NAD the body cannot run the higher metabolic systems which define health. Without NAD+, the gap between eating food and using it as energy can not be covered. BUT, healing the gut is a non negotiable if someone wants his body to be able to properly absorb niacin (and every other nutrient). No matter the dietary niacin amounts that someone might consume, if his gut health is suboptimal, the niacin levels in his body will be insufficient and thus the NAD levels will be as well (again, niacin is needed to form NAD). A lot of people consume enough animal products in order to get their B vitamins in but they still experience a deficiency in many of them and this usually is due to gut dysbiosis, thus one should focus on healing his gut for up to 16 weeks in order for his body to be able to properly absorb B vitamins. Supplementing niacinamide for up to 8 weeks (never supplement niacinamide for more than 8 weeks) can be beneficial if a person’s metabolism is harmed, but it should be done very carefully meaning that a person should follow a set of rules when supplementing niacin/niacinamide and if he does not, he could even harm the kynurenine pathway. Rule 1:Make sure you have enough vitamin A, magnesium,copper, glycine, glutamine, zinc and B2 in your system before you even consider supplementing niacinamide. This means that bone marrow/bone broth, magnesium glycinate or citrate, brewer’s yeast (you can take brewer’s yeast daily), a biweekly dose of 100gr of beef liver and weekly oysters should be consumed for 3-4 weeks before a person starts supplementing niacin. Instead of supplementing niacinamide for these weeks, a person should focus on whole food sources of niacin such as: figs, raw dairy and some homemade spelt or einkorn bread but only after at least 3 months of not consuming any grains. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",570
Page 141,"You need bone marrow as a source of aminos since when a person is suffering from conversion/metabolic problems, the rate of the conversion of tryptophan to niacin and NAD slows down, which causes an increase in tryptophan and excess tryptophan can cause severe derangements in someone’s metabolism and be converted to torporific hormones such as serotonin. So the best solution(s) for this is to balance the amino acid profile in someone’s diet by consuming bone marrow or even collagen. Do not ignore these. Rule 2:Never supplement niacin on an empty stomach. In order for niacin supplementation to improve our metabolic rate, we need to supply the nutrients required to run the kynurenine pathway and ignite the metabolism before consuming niacinamide in a supplemental form. An example of a meal that could be eaten in order to optimize the utilization of supplemental niacin is free range eggs cooked in coconut oil, seasonal fruit, some beta carotene from pumpkin or squash, a small piece of honeycomb and some taurine (taurine directly increases conversion of tryptophan to niacinamide) or in case you want to drink coffee, a small cup of coffee. If you can also wash the niacinamide with a little bone broth that will be ideal also. Rule 3:Why are you supplementing 500mg of niacin? The niacin flush, should be invigorating and pleasant, not a torture. For this reason, even a dose of 100mg might be too much in the beginning. If that’s the case, then the person instead of supplementing niacinamide, should focus on dietary consumption of B3 rich foods that were mentioned and as presented in rule 2 but with the extra supplementation of taurine which will also allow him to consume every once in a while food like poultry which are not generally recommended if a person’s metabolic health is suboptimal but can be beneficial in some cases. In general, if a) the niacin flush is a torture you have overdone it and b) you can not feel the pleasant effects of niacin in 30-45 minutes, you either consumed a small ammount or did something wrong (did not eat enough or did not exposure yourself to sunlight afterwards (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is a highly photosensitive molecule)).

Page 142,"Now let’s talk about glutathione since a lack of antioxidant activity may result in thyroid damage from hydrogen peroxide every time Iodine is processed by the thyroid. Glutathione is a substance made from the amino acids glycine, cysteine, and glutamic acid. It is produced by the liver andisresponsible for detoxification and thyroid hormone conversion. Glutathione plays a role in many chemical reactions in our body, helps detoxify chemicals and protects our mitochondria against oxidative stress. Lower glutathione levels appear to go hand-in-hand with poor thyroid function since glutathione pathways help the conversion of T4 to T3. Glutathione is an antioxidant dependent on selenium and produced in the cytosol of the cell. How to boost glutathione production 101 1)Consume sulfur rich foodssuch as fish, beef, onions,garlic, shallots and broccoli once in a while after you’ve healed your gut. 2)Consume vitamin C and E rich foods.Vitamin C maintainsthe body’s supply of antioxidants, including glutathione and helps reprocess glutathione by converting oxidized glutathione back to its active form. Good sources of dietary vitamin C are: berries, kiwis, pomegranates, grapefruits, orange juice (no pulp), berrie juice (no pulp). Good sources of vitamin E are EVOO and organic palm kernel oil. 3)Consume selenium rich foods.Selenium is a glutathionecofactor, meaning it’s a substance needed for glutathione activity and will lead to increased glutathione peroxidase levels. Good dietary sources of selenium are: beef, fish, organ meats and Brazil nuts. 4)Start adding turmeric in your meals once in a while.Numerous animal and test-tube studies have shown that turmeric and curcumin extract have the ability to increase glutathione levels. Just make sure to add some black pepper to turmeric to help the absorption. 5)Other important nutrients that our body needs to make and recycle glutathione are:magnesium, zinc, B vitamins, glycineand glutamine which can all be found in animal products such as organs, oysters, free range eggs and bone marrow, brewer’s yeast and some sprouted white rice cooked in bone broth. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",510
Page 143,"If you choose to supplement NAC in order to boost glutathione just know that it will deplete copper levels and should be avoided long term. Number 5: Toxic loads Nowadays toxins are everywhere and one of the organs that affect the most is the thyroid since it has one of the highest rates of blood flow in our bodies. These toxic loads will be properly addressed in the xenoestrogen and heavy metal detox part. Number 6: Stressful states Stress will directly suppress thyroid production. Stress hormones such as cortisol tear down the thyroid, adrenals and other endocrine glands (adrenaline depletes glycogen stores) and stressful states should be avoided. So here are 4 simple dietary rules you need to follow in order to prevent these states. Number 1:Stick to your maintenance calories. Overeating and undereating are both big stressors. Overeating can lead to chronically elevated levels of the free fatty acids and undereating just makes you a vessel for cortisol. Which will result in blood glucose dysregulation, wrecked hormones and even more stress down the road. (We should mention though that under-eating is way worse than over-eating though. Way worse.) Most people's caloric needs can get covered via 3 meals a day. Number 2: Keep B vitamins and magnesium at hand. If you have never supplement any B vitamins or magnesium, now is the time to do it because the foods which will help you “battle” stress from a biological standpoint will have carbs. The foods that will help you battle stress effectively are: free range whole eggs, freshly squeezed grapefruit juice (no pulp and add some sea salt to it), local and seasonal fruit and raw milk with local raw honey. So always keep some fruit and eggs in hand as a snack. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",375
Page 144,"Number 3: Do not go low on either carbs or protein. The ideal number for protein seems to be 1.7gr per KG of body weight and for carbs to be around 30-40% of your total calories. Number 4: Make sure to consume enough vitamin C and copper through foods such as organ meats and berries. But doNOTcombine high iron foods such as organ meatsand beef with foods high in vitamin C. You need vitamin C under this context (stressful states) since it prevents the excessive oxidation of adrenaline and the adrenal glands which are probably already in a fatigued state, concentrate more vitamin C than any other organ in the body (except the pituitary). We mentioned the need for carbs when it comes to thyroid performance but we forgot to mention fats and protein. Ditching bad fats such as canola oil, sunflower oil and so on as we will address in PUFA detox is also crucial for thyroid recovery and adding good fats such as coconut oil, cocoa butter, grass fed butter and ghee, tallo, raw dairy and even shea butter in one’s diet is necessary for the remodeling of tissues. Cells need good fats and they should not be neglected because without good fats our cells won’t rebuild properly. If you don’t know which fat source to start with, start with coconut oil since it will stimulate the production of pregnenolone and if provided with enough vitamin A through the doses of beef liver that were mentioned, it will greatly help thyroid performance. A sufficient protein intake is also important for thyroid performance since many amino acids found in protein participate in pathways which regulate thyroid function and the body synthesizes many hormones with protein.

In order to experience the maximum benefits of the thyroid supportive meal plan, it is a good idea to spend 1-4 weeks exclusively healing your gut first. After 6-12 weeks of implementing what we have discussed so far, you should experience signs of improved metabolic function such as: ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",304

Hashimoto’sis an autoimmune condition where the bodystarts attacking its own thyroid gland. When this happens it will show up in your blood work through thyroid antibodies. Hypothyroidism is one common cause of severe depression as well (especially in women) so it is not uncommon for someone’s mood to dramatically improve when focusing on optimizing thyroid performance. In this case, please also go get your thyroid panel tested in case you have not and if you are an older woman, you could benefit from progesterone as well. PUFA detox If you take 95% of today’s packaged foods that are in any food store and look at the ingredient list, you’ll notice that they contain some kind of seed oil in them and the question is why? How did a failed soap project (literally) end up on our plates? ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",259
Page 157,"First of all, calling seed oils “oils” is a lie. They are not oils. If you take a bunch of olives and squeeze them you can get actual “oil” out of them but if you take a bunch of seeds and squeeze them you’ll get nothing. So how are these corporations making oils out of seeds exactly? Well first, they gather the seeds they want to make an “oil” out of, such as GMO soy, cotton , rapeseed etc. Then these “seeds” are heated to extremely high temperatures obviously causing the seeds to oxidize creating extremely powerful and cancerous byproducts. (Something that should not be ignored since cancer patients can not possibly recover from cancer if they keep eating seed oils. Seed oils can also directly cause cancer since they destroy our metabolism and cancer is a metabolic disease at its core). Then the seeds are processed with apetroleum-basedsolvent such as hexane to maximize the amount of “oil” extracted from them. Next they use more chemicals to deodorize the oils since they smell horrendous and finally more chemicals are added to improve their color. Now how is this actually good for us? We’re consuming cheap gasoline for God’s shakes but yet this poison is hidden everywhere these days. Cottonseed oil (a common seed “oil”) in several studies decreased the lifespan of mice in half. HALF. Not only that, but it made them severely sick for their entire lifespan. Their quality of life was pretty bad. They were in a zombie-like state. You don’t need to know that seed oils are high in PUFAs which break down into toxic byproducts like HNE, acrolein and MDA when oxidized resulting in heart attacks , cancer, Alzheimer's , diabetes and damaging metabolic function in general in order to learn from experience that they harm you. If you want to understand what causes disease and what promotes health, start thinking in terms of what promotes and what harms metabolic health. This should be our number 1 criteria. So since seed oils remodel the cardiolipin structure of mitochondria (the energy centers of the cell) causing cellular death and leakage of potassium they destroy our metabolism and should be avoided. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",480
Page 158,"You’ve probably also heard the terms saturated and unsaturated fat. Seed oils are unsaturated fats which are more reactive to oxygen since they lack hydrogen atoms (leading to oxidative stress and disease). Oxidized PUFA can be dangerous when in our bodies, especially since oxidative damage to fat-containing LDL particles is a primary factor in the development of heart disease. And an omega-6 rich diet greatly increases oxidized LDL levels. The more PUFA we eat, the more that accumulates in our bodies' adipose tissue. So they age you, increase estrogen and other stress hormones (which are the primary drive of cancer (cancer cells also are known to have very high levels of unsaturated fat and when a diet is rich in unsaturated fats, tumors grow very rapidly) and since every cell in your body needs “fat” (every cell membrane is made out of fat/cholesterol), when you’re not consuming saturated fats but unsaturated fats, your cell membranes will be made out of these poisons and you’ll have suboptimal protection against harmful everyday compounds. Seed oils/PUFAs also mess with your digestion in a very unique way. They literally destroy our bodies ability to digest food. Not just seed oils. ANY food resulting in insufficient absorption of nutrients and sickness as a result of that. Your digestion is the tool our body has in order to absorb everything it needs in order to function properly. If our digestion is messed up, we become dysfunctional be default In Israel there is a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, non insulin dependent diabetes, obesity, autoimmune diseases(*) and cancer which seems to be caused by PUFAs since there is a lack of other environmental pollutants and habits that could lead to these diseases (you can look up “the Israel paradox”). (*)PUFAs weaken the immune system's function in ways that are similar to the damage caused by radiation. Notice that diabetes is included there. Seed oils/PUFAs are a bigger cause for diabetes than sugar. We’re obviously not crazy for stating that. It’s not rocket science if you understand that seed oil consumption destroys your ability to metabolize carbs in general. It goes back to the fact that they cause oxidative destruction of mitochondria which oxidize carbohydrates for energy. PUFA metabolites (leukotrienes) might even trigger Type 1 diabetes whichis an autoimmune condition (the beta-cells of the pancreas get attacked by the immune ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",519
Page 159,"system and over time this leads to their destruction and inability to produce insulin). PUFA metabolites may also drive lots of bacterial infections and make people resistant to already very strong antibiotics which destroy their microbiomes. PUFA consumption has been shown to greatly affect mood disorders also. Linoleic acid increases the expression of nuclear factor NF-kB, the transition of NF-kB stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokines which have a negative impact on the CNS. So PUFA might not only affect existing mood disorders but also cause them. Unfortunately one common seed oil that is hidden in a lot of products is soybean oil which besides causing metabolic disease can severely affect and exacerbate autism, Alzheimer’s, panic disorders and once again depression. One more thing that is worth mentioning is that PUFAs greatly decrease your body’s ability to produce thyroid hormones (this is one of the reason why butter “alternatives” for example that are filled with canola oil usually, lead to a massive increase of LDL in even a couple of months of consuming them since high serum cholesterol 99.99999% of the time is a sign of hypothyroidism). Now by stating that seed oils are bad, we’re not saying that every single one of them is bad for your health. Blackseed oil for example can be a miraculous health tool for some conditions. When we mention seed oils from now on please keep in mind that we’re referring to oils such us: sunflower oil, almond oil, canola oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, flaxseed oil, rapeseed oil and in general oils that did not exist 2000 years ago. PUFAs in nature exist with a pretty high dose of vitamin E as well. So a food high in bioavailable vitamin E such as palm kernel oil or a quality vitamin E supplement are useful for most people in this day and age since everyone has unconsciously been consuming seed oils for years and our body’s need for vitamin E (and also C) when that happens skyrocket. How inferior fats such as canola oil cause heart disease 101 A free radical reacts with a fatty acid and steals one of its electrons. The fatty acid then becomes a free radical that can react with another fatty acid nearby. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",472
Page 160,"As this chain reaction continues, the permeability and fluidity of cell membranes changes, proteins in cell membranes experience decreased activity, and receptor proteins undergo changes in structure that either alter or stop their function. If receptor proteins designed to react to insulin levels undergo a structural change it can negatively affect glucose uptake. Free radical reactions can continue unchecked unless stopped by a defense mechanism. How to detox from seed oils faster in order to increase testosterone, boost thyroid and improve metabolic health. - Stop consuming seed oils. - Get in the sauna 2-3 times a week from 10-20 minutes. - Avoid fatty meats for a while unless (especially pork) you can afford grass-finished meats (or at least meats from a small farm that does not poison their animals). -Stick to fat sources such as: ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",174
Page 161,"1.Coconut oil 2.EVOO (extra virgin olive oil) 3.Grass fed butter/ghee 4.Free range eggs 5.Raw dairy. -Get on turmeric Just make sure to add some pepper to help the absorption and do not overdo it. A couple of dashes are enough. Also do not consume turmeric if your iron levels are low. (After reading this book and implementing what you’ll read, this will probably be fixed). - No nut butters. - Quality vitamin E from palm kernel oil. - Raw honey (1 teaspoon) Buy it from a local beekeeper if you can. - Pomegranates - Blueberries - Raspberries - Strawberries - Goji berries - Cherries - Grapefruit juice (no more than 6-8 oz a day) - Blackberries -Daily teaspoon of coconut oil The seed oils we mentioned are destroying everyone’s health, not just mens. So do your best in order to avoid them and stick to quality fat sources since fat is an extremely important macronutrient the body needs for many biological processes. Replacing seed oils with coconut oil, EVOO and quality dairy WILL massively improve your health in multiple ways. There are many benefits of following a low PUFA diet such as: ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",278
Page 162,"●Blood sugar regulation- PUFAs can damage the cells in your pancreas that produce insulin. If you want to lose body fat and achieve a high level of health, you want a very effective blood sugar handling system. PUFAs can damage this system. For those with blood sugar handling issues the primary focus is usually reduced sugar intake, however, I believe it makes more sense to reduce PUFAs from your diet. ●Skin health- PUFAs are closely linked to age pigmentformation. In addition, a high level of PUFA in your body means when you are exposed to the sun, free radical damage is more likely. ●Metabolism- PUFAs can stress various systems in yourbody, particularly the rate at which our cells produce energy (aka our metabolism). This has numerous implications for thyroid health and general hormonal balance. ●Digestion / Immune System- PUFAs can impair proteindigestion. Digestion problems are rampant in this day and age, eliminating PUFAs are an often overlooked and very effective way at supporting digestion. Your immune system is closely linked to your digestive system, a problem with digestion almost guarantees a poorly functioning immune system. ●Detoxification- The liver plays a major role in detoxification,PUFAs can overburden the liver. That sluggish feeling you feel after eating out? You may have just consumed PUFAs. Plan of Action ●Avoid PUFA oils to the best of your ability, especially for cooking. ●Always use heat stable fats for cooking (i.e. coconut oil, ghee, butter, tallow). ●Limit the amount of times per week you eat out. ●If you consume animal products ensure that the animals are not fed any PUFA. This means consuming grass-fed beef and pasture raised eggs and poultry. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",384
Page 163,"●Vitamin E will help offset the damage caused by PUFAs so make sure to have some palm kernel oil in your house. ●Do not neglect saturated fats since they can offset the damage caused by PUFAs. ●Do not neglect vitamin C. ●Visit the sauna 2-3 times per week. ●Slowly lose some fat if you are above 13% bf for men and 15% for women. PUFAs can also decrease testosterone by up to 300ng/dL. Let’s see why. PUFAs and Leydig cells Leydig cells are cells located in the testes of the male gonads. They are known as testicular interstitial cells and can be found between seminiferous tubules, which contain Sertoli and germ cells. Together, these three cell types maintain spermatogenesis, control hormonal regulation, and affect secondary sexual characteristics in males. Leydig cells are under hormonal regulation by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. These cells can be associated with some pathologic changes or cancerous malformation. Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone or androgens in males. This physiology allows them to play a crucial role in many vital physiological processes in males, including sperm production or spermatogenesis, controlling sexual development, and maintaining secondary sexual characteristics and behaviors. Now the free radicals that polyunsaturated fatty acids create, will damage the Leydig cells and cause a drop in testosterone levels by even up to 30% in 21 day. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",323
Page 164,"Heavy metal detox Note: You should focus on heavy metal detox after 12 weeks of implementing what we have discussed so far, otherwise it can be counterproductive. First of all, what diseases do heavy metals cause and what are the signs of heavy metal toxicity? Gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction, nervous system disorders, skin lesions, vascular damage, immune system dysfunction, birth defects, and cancer are examples of the complications of heavy metals toxic effects. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",100
Page 165,Note: a heavy metal detox will make you feel under the weather and should be saved for the times that your productivity can take a hit. When we are talking about heavy metals under the detox concept we are mainly talking about: -Iron -Mercury -Lead -Arsenic -Aluminum -Cadmium Which can even promote epigenetic alterations including DNA methylation and histone modification. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC,93
Page 166,"First of all, what vitamins and minerals protect us against all of these? 1) Zinc (counteracts the toxicity of mercury, lead and aluminum and plays a key role in iron homeostasis). 2) Selenium (counteracts the toxicity of mercury and lead). 3) Vitamin C (NOT combined with foods high in iron) ( plays key role in iron homeostasis) 4) Magnesium (protects cells against all heavy metals). 5) Copper (Copper is one of the main regulators of iron). So a few dietary tools against heavy metals are:Pomegranates,berries, beef liver with turmeric and black pepper (to prevent the absorption of excess iron), oysters, raw dairy, some brazil nuts, magnesium glycinate, and cacao. Now let’s see these metals one by one in more detail. Heavy metal number 1: Lead Lead is a neurotoxin. A neurotoxin acts on the nervous system and disrupts the normal function of nerve cells. Lead is also associated with major depression, reduced IQ and anxiety disorder. Lead also disturbs the balance of the oxidant-antioxidant system (see redox on chapter 1.1) and thus induces inflammatory responses in many organs via direct effect on membrane lipid peroxidation. Lead can enter your home in various ways, one of these being your water line. This is true especially for older homes that might have lead solder and when the water sits in copper pipes for any length of time, the lead used to join the pipes can break down and make its way to your kitchen sink or bathtub. So, in order to minimize exposure to lead you should first invest in a water filter in order to filter the water that you drink and cook your foods in, but you should filter your showering water. As we shower, heat opens up our pores allowing trace amounts of toxins to be absorbed through our skin. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",401
Page 167,"In general, our skin is a sponge and we should be very careful when it comes to what we put on it. Always remember that without a water filter your kidneys will become the filter. Then, lead can also be found in coloured ceramic dishes and spices that come from India and China. The solutions to these are to buy wooden bowls and find spices that come from Latin America if you live nearby or local ones. Another thing you should avoid if you do not want to consume lead, is food additives. For reducing blood lead levels the most important things to consume are: 1)Raw milk ( calcium is well known to decrease gastrointestinal lead absorption) 2)Thiamine (B1) which is a chelator for most of the heavy metals 3)Folate (B9) 4)Sulfur rich foods such as onions since heavy metals in general have an affinity to bind sulfur 5) Vitamin E Note: Lead can also cause anemia, so in case someone’s anemia is not reactive to the traditional methods of treatment (given that both B vitamin and vitamin C stores are optimal) there might be an underlying lead exposure going on. Heavy metal number 2: Cadmium Cadmium is classified as a known human carcinogen and causes severe damage to someone's kidneys and lungs. Symptoms to be aware of when it comes to cadmium are sudden and intense weight loss, hypertension, vomiting and diarrhea. In order to avoid the most common sources of cadmium for most people, ditch breakfast cereal and breakfast grains in general ( the only thing you can consume after 16 weeks of this program is organic oat bran with some coconut oil, cacao ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",350
Page 168,"and raw milk in order to reduce endotoxins).and pay attention to the tobacco you consume. But cadmium exposure besides the above is very unlikely unless you smoke shady tobacco brands (the very unregulated and very cheap ones) which are contaminated with cadmium and should be avoided by a) quitting smoking or b) if you are going to smoke stick to organic tobacco. Raw milk will help battle a possible cadmium toxicity. Note: If you are considering using dmsa for heavy metals, please consult your doctor first and get hair and blood tests to see if you actually have heavy metal poisoning. Heavy metal number 3: Aluminum Aluminum is another neurotoxin which can pass the blood brain barrier very easily and has been linked with most of the neurological diseases since oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction cause neurodegeneration. First of all, get rid of aluminum pots and pans since this can add aluminum in your food up to 2mg. The second problem is aluminum based food additives found usually in baking soda that does not clarify that is aluminum free and some cheeses(*) (always buy dairy products from small local farmers). (*)Cheese in a serving of frozen pizzas had up to 14 mg of aluminum! Aluminum can also be found in cosmetic products such as deodorants and toothpastes, but fortunately we now have many natural alternatives for these. For reducing blood aluminum levels the most important things to consume are: 1)Zinc (oysters) 2)Vitamin C 3) Thiamine 4)Vitamin B6 (try to stay away from synthetic vitamin B6 since it will harm your liver) ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",341
Page 169,"5)Copper from beef liver in order to supplement NAC for a short period of time which will deplete copper levels and the most important of all when it comes to aluminum is 6)Magnesium malatewhich has the ability to bind aluminum andremove it from the body. Heavy metal number 4: Mercury Mercury is yet another heavy metal that crosses the blood brain barrier and it has been linked with many mental problems. Mercury is a naturally occuring, toxic heavy metal. There are two types of mercury we need to pay attention to since all the other ones have been discontinued from the products that were used in. Number 1 is organic mercury/methylmercury. Methylmercury is a powerful neurotoxin and people exposed to high levels will experience adverse health effects. Exposure to methylmercury most commonly occurs when people eat kinds of fish and shellfish that have high levels of methylmercury in their tissues. The things to avoid are big fish such as tuna, swordfish, do not buy salmon if you can not afford a wild caught voodoo one since it is one of the dirtiest foods you can get your hands one (farmed salmon eat their own feces) and stick to small fish. (Selenium is the most effective dietary compound against methylmercury). Number 2 is elemental (metallic) mercury. Exposures to metallic mercury most often occur when metallic mercury is spilled, or when products that contain metallic mercury break, so that mercury is exposed to the air. If your dentist tells you that silver/mercury amalgams are safe, get a new dentist. Now if you already have silver amalgams already, a dentist could replace them quite easily and safely. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",359
Page 170,"Heavy metal number 5: Arsenic Arsenic is known to cause an increase in lung, bladder and skin cancers. Arsenic is a metalloid, meaning it can exhibit some properties both of metals and non-metals which finds its way into air, food, soil and groundwater. Exposure to arsenic happens through unfiltered water, some seafood and rice based products. Sprouted white rice is a health food if cooked in bone broth and should not be eliminated. What you should do instead is avoid rice products made out of big food companies and always soak rice overnight, draining it and rinsing it before you cook it. This opens up the grain and allows arsenic to be washed out. The most effective tool against arsenic are pectins which we will discuss soon. Heavy metal number 6: Iron. The biggest heavy metal issue we face today is unbound iron. Most people today consume way too many PUFAs and their iron homeostasis is far from optimal. This results in a lot of oxidative stress and thus metabolic problems. Copper and vitamin C are the main regulators of iron homeostasis. If you are not a child you need very little iron to maintain health and obviously not the kind of raw metal shavings which are added to iron fortified foods such as common wheat. Unbound iron can destroy your entire metabolism (and thus cause cancer, Alzheimer’s and many other diseases) like nothing else. Iron is highly unstable unless properly bound and buffered by some specific proteins such as lactoferrin. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",325
Page 171,"To put it simply the problem is not iron itself exactly but when it's present in its free form because due to its ability to participate in redox reactions, iron is a catalyst for the formation of hydroxyl radicals from reduced forms of O2. Reducing excess iron will help someone with all sorts of niche health areas such as heal cancer, hair-loss, acne, eczema, insomnia, ED, chronic fatigue and so on. Unbound iron contributes to illnesses through the promotion of bacteria and viruses which need iron in order to replicate. This alters our microbiota and feeds pathogenic species of bacteria which excrete toxic compounds that destroy our internal organs. Surprisingly, one of the most common causes of bloating when consuming grains is not gluten (which i am not a fun of in hybridized grains but more about this in lesson 2), but the iron that they fortify the cereals with. This form of iron causes an immediate increase in bacteria and their excretory products then harm the digestive tract, causing spasms, bloating, and diarrhea or constipation. But what about anemia? Doesn’t an anemic person need to consume more iron? The short answer is no. Anemia in 99% of the cases is not actually caused by a lack of iron in the diet but a deficit of the vitamins and nutrients which are involved in the metabolism of iron with the most common ones being vitamin A, vitamin D, biotin and vitamin C which is required to keep iron in a biologically soluble state. What can we do about unbound iron? ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",330
Page 172,"First of all be patient since regulating iron homeostasis can take up to a year and this illustrates that iron homeostasis is not something to be taken lightly. Step 1: Stop consuming iron fortified foods (avoid all grains) and stop consuming foods extremely high in iron for 3 months. Step 2: Get on a very small dose of a natural antibiotic such as oregano oil since antibiotics bind to iron preventing it being used by bacteria. This will also help you with any candida overgrowth you might be facing (Now food’s candida support is a surprisingly good supplement also). Ideally you want to consume 3-5 days(not on back to back days) of the antibiotic per week for 2-3 weeks in total followed by 2-3 weeks of a probiotic/colostrum. If the antibiotic somewhat dysregulates your gut and causes “some” stress (without any pain obviously), it’s a sign that yes, in fact you were struggling with some candida overgrowth. Step 3: start adding in your diet the following foods: pineapple, carrots, squash, pumpkin and garlic/onions/broccoli since sulfur strongly binds to excess iron and foods high in manganese every once in a while such as maple syrup. Step 4: start adding turmeric and black pepper to your meat once in a while. Step 5: consider supplementing with 200-500mg of vitamin C and 50-100mg of thiamine for up to 4 weeks since both of these is crucial for iron regulation and the excretion of any extra iron through the skin and urine (if you have too much unbound iron and supplement thiamine, you might find that you smell bad after about 45-90 minutes of consuming it). Vitamin C will help remove iron that is stored in the tissues and prevent it from oxidizing. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",391
Page 173,"Step 6: the weekly oysters with some turmeric and black pepper, should take care of any zinc deficiency that might be present and cause an iron excess while preventing iron absorption from oysters. Step 7: consider supplementing with brewer’s yeast since riboflavin (B2) can prevent pathogenic bacteria from using iron. Step 8: Biweekly beef liver since vitamin A stimulates the release of iron that is stored in the tissues. Step 9: No alcohol for 4-12 weeks since alcohol stimulates the increased uptake of iron by tissues. The absorption of iron is also stimulated when stress hormones are elevated and thus the diet plan that was presented in chapter 1.2 about thyroid with the addition of one more type of organ meat such as beef kidney or heart once a week, is ideal for optimizing iron homeostasis since it has plenty of copper in it as well and the replacement of copper by iron in someone’s diet will dramatically increase estrogen. At this stage, older women can benefit from careful progesterone or even progesterone supplementation as well for this reason. How to detox from heavy metals the safe way. The safest and extremely efficient way to detox from heavy metals after making sure that the nutrient needs are covered, is binders. Binders latch onto heavy metals and refuse to let them go until they reach the body’s exit door aka the bathroom. Without a binder, heavy metals (and other endotoxins) are quickly reabsorbed into the bloodstream. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",317
Page 174,"Binder #1 Activated charcoal (AC) Activated charcoal is made by heating carbon rich material such as wood, peat or coconut shells to a very high temperature and the AC then becomes a fine black powder which when consumed will bind to tons of endotoxins (from heavy metals, to xenoestrogens, to parasites) because it carries slight negative electrical charge which acts like a magnet for the positively charged toxins. AC is so effective for being a binder that emergency rooms use it to treat overdoses. BUT, if taken for over a few weeks it will bind into important minerals and antioxidants so it should be treated very carefully and when someone chooses to consume it he should also supplement with magnesium, drink raw milk, eat sea salt and not skip on oysters or organ meats. Binder #2 Bentonite clay Bentonite clay has been used for centuries to pull out toxins from the body. But we will not get deep into this tool since a) it can be very dangerous and b) most people do not need it. Binder #3 Chlorella Chlorella is a genus of single celled green algae belonging to the division Chlorophyta and it likes to bind mercury and lead in the gut. When it comes to chlorella we are talking about chlorella pyrenoidosa. Binding tool #4: Pectins Pectin is a naturally occurring substance found in berries, apples and other fruit. There are two types of pectin that are recommended: First: citrus pectin Second apple pectin Binding tool #5 IMD (Intestinal metal detox) IMD is highly purified silica(*) with covalently bonded elements. IMD binds to heavy metals such as mercury in the gut and comes in a powdered form. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",375
Page 175,"You should not start with IMD since it can be expensive and should be treated very very carefully and you should never take it for more than 4-5 DAYS at a time. (*)Silicon enriched water can remove aluminum via the urine. Binding tool#6 (personal favorite): Zeolites When we are talking about zeolites we are talking about naturally occurring zeolites which were volcanic rock and ash finds alkaline groundwater that its negative charge binds to positively charged toxins and traps not only EVERY harmful heavy metal but many other harmful compounds as well. They are my personal favorite because unlike things such as activated charcoal do not remove vital nutrients and minerals. The binders you should start with are apple pectin and then zeolites. Note: In case you’re into tattoos, you should avoid inks that do not clarify if they are heavy metal free. Some inks are so bad that when i gave 8/10 of my tattooed clients hust 1-2 grams of zeolites, they felt some serious withdrawal-like symptoms (it was bad). They also amplify the negative effects of nnEMF. Xenoestrogen detox Xenoestrogens are estrogen mimicking compounds which are not produced by your body and harm your mitochondria. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",271
Page 176,"They are structurally or functionally related to human sex hormone 17β-estradiol and bind the estrogen receptors. Xenoestrogens are suspected to be associated with altered reproductive function in males and females, increased incidence of breast cancer, prostate cancer, hormonal imbalances, obesity, abnormal growth patterns and neurodevelopmental delays in children, as well as changes in immune function. Estrogens and their metabolites after all are in general known to be involved in the pathogenesis of cancerous illness of breast, uterus, ovary, testicle, prostate and kidney. They can also affect the mood in a negative way both for men and for women. The problems xenoestrogens cause are endless. The main problems testosterone wise are: increased aromatase enzyme activity and SHBG. So xenoestrogens lower both testosterone and free testosterone. Estrogens by the way are not the female hormones, progesterone is. Estrogens are stress hormones and that’s why estrogen dominance always leads to physical degeneration. Xenoestrogens are recognized by the body almost as normal estrogens so they are one of the main reasons for estrogen dominance in today’s society. Some common symptoms of estrogen dominance in men include: 1.Man boobs 2.Weight gain 3.ED 4.Gut problems such as leaky gut ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",281
Page 177,"5.Muscle weakness 6.Thyroid problems 7.Infertility 8.Liver problems 9.Mood swings 10. Hair loss 11. Insomnia 12. Hot flashes Xenoestrogens are a huge time bomb ticking. It’s an epigenetic war. Xenoestrogens are everywhere nowadays, here’s what you should get rid of first and foremost. No PUFAs. Yes you read this right. PUFA is a xenoestrogen.PUFAsare as potent of a xenoestrogen as the ones we are about to see and have a detrimental effect on the reproductive (they also promote cancer on the reproductive organs) and the endocrine system in general (both for men and women). No plastic. Most plastic products can release chemicals that act like estrogen even in products that don't contain BPA. (BPA is a weak synthetic estrogen). BPA is an endocrine disruptor, numerous studies have found that animals which were exposed to even low levels of BPA, had elevated rates of prostate cancer, decreased sperm count, diabetes, low testosterone and neurological problems. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",241
Page 178,"Plastic also contains phthalates which areassociated with increasedprenatal mortality, reduced growth and birth weight. Some plastic products also contain benzophenones but these are a bigger threat in personal care products since they come in direct contact with our skin. Note: some product’s labels might say “BPA free” but most of them include BPS which you should also avoid. Just say no to plastic as much as possible. It’s good for the environment too. No “fragrances”. The chemicals used in order to make “fragrances” are classified as allergens , hormone disruptors , asthma triggers , neurotoxins , carcinogens and they also contain phthalates, which are a serious endocrine disruption. Fragrances frequently cause allergies, dermatitis, respiratory distress and reproductive problems. No triclosan. Triclosan is also an endocrine disruptor which the FDA has banned from soaps but not toothpastes and has shown to decrease some thyroid hormones. No parabens. Parabens are the mother of all xenoestrogens since they are absorbed so quickly by your skin. Parabens are associated with increased risk of breast cancer and they can be found in makeup, body washes, deodorants, shampoos and facial cleansers. So you basically need to get rid of all the toxic feeled shampoos , moisturizers , sunscreens , fragrances, toothpastes, shaving creams and cleaning products. No PFAS/PFCS ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",337
Page 179,"PFAS are used to create non-stick surfaces mostly and are toxic and when heated they release perfluorooctanoic acid which is linked to thyroid disease, infertility, and a lot of reproductive problems. The US EPA has aruled perfluorinated compounds PFCs as ""likely carcinogens. PFCs are used to create heat-resistant and non-stick coatings as well. Here are some natural alternatives to all of these. -Mineral based sunscreens and deodorants. -Olive oil soap. -Aloe vera. -Coconut oil (from sunscreen, to mouthwash). -For a quick toothpaste recipe try mixing (aluminum free) baking soda, sea salt and coconut oil. -ACV for cleaning. -Natural peppermint spray. -Glass “tupperware”. -Old school skillets and wood cutting boards. -Stick to clothes made out of cotton and merino wool (this one is important). The clothes we wear matter for our health more than we might want to think since our entire body is in direct contact with them. Polyester for example increase miscarriages in women and reduces male fertility at a scary rate. Also many people nowadays have developed acne all over their body due to polyester (especially if they wear polyester at the gym). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",287
Page 180,"Say no to soy fast fashion brands a)for your own health and b) since they mistreat underaged workers. Last but definitely not least…..NO TAP WATER! Most of our bodies contain water. Water is a carrier, well the problem is what it carries. Besides atrazine, a powerful endocrine disruptor that makes the frogs gay, here are 12 common dangerous substances that can be found in tap water. Number 1: Chlorine Chlorine is commonly added to tap water. The problem with chlorine is that it gets absorbed very quickly through your skin and that’s the reason why we mention it as the number 1. Because if you’re a regular human being when you think about tap water you probably think about the water you drink but not the water you shower in. Your skin is a sponge and absorbs anything you put on it. Chlorine is one of the reasons that people who regularly swim in pools face health issues such as thyroid issues. A few years ago, filtering my showering water would seem absurd, but this small habit has significantly improved my health even though i was not struggling with serious health issues. When chlorine enters the body (either by you drinking tap water or showering with it) it produces corrosive acids. This leads to a slow destruction of the glands that “hydrate” your organs (your skin is an organ by the way and if you’re suffering from dry skin you should start filtering your water). Number 2: Arsenic Another reason to filter your showering water is arsenic. Obviously arsenic is a very dangerous compound and you should do your best to avoid it. Consuming even small doses of it can lead to nerve paralysis and blindness.Arsenic can ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",369
Page 181,"also cause lung and skin cancers and may cause other cancers (the association between chronic arsenic exposure and cancer is strongest for skin, lung, and bladder cancer). Arsenic is also one of the reasons that it’s better to stick to oysters and wild caught fish for your seafood source since the highest levels of arsenic (in all forms) in foods can be found in non wild caught seafood. Number 3: Sodium fluoride I’m not against fluoride but sodium fluoride which is a powerful calcium chelator. Sodium fluoride was first added to the water in order to prevent cavities which is absurd. If they wanted to prevent cavities they might as well have added zinc picolinate. Sodium fluoride weakens the bones and makes them more prone to fractures. It can also trigger tumors as well as aiding their growth and spread. Today we’re exposed to levels of sodium fluoride so high that lead to iodine displacement which is probably one of the reasons that 67/75 studies found reduced IQ in humans after fluoride exposure since iodine deficiency can lead to a decrease of 15 IQ points. Also, the sodium fluoride levels in your drinking water are twice as important for thyroiditis as your family history is. Iodine deficiency by the way is easy to fix and no you should not supplement with iodine or eat “iodine infused” salt. First start by throwing away your toxic toothpaste and switching to a natural one (you can try organic coconut oil as a mouthwash), filtering your drinking and showering water, then make sure you have enough magnesium and selenium in your system since without a sufficient amount of these cofactors iodine can get pretty toxic. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",350
Page 182,"Good sources of magnesium are supplements (most magnesium supplements that do not contain artificial sweeteners are surprisingly good), spinach cooked in grass fed butter and organic cacao after you’ve fixed any possible gut issues and take a break from high oxalate foods. Also make sure to eat oysters and beef liver (not on the same day) once a week since magnesium can mess up with your zinc levels if they are not in propel levels and last but not least, eat a very VERY small pinch of organic kelp every other day for a month and then only 1-2 times a week. You should also make sure that you have enough vitamin C in your system that’s coming from things such as berries. Just do not eat foods high in vitamin C with foods that are high in iron. Separate these two in a 2+ hour window. Now if you don’t struggle with an iodine deficiency but an iodine excess, selenium can cure iodine excess pretty fast. Also boron will displace fluoride from the glands so you may want to do a short term (just 2-4 weeks and that’s it) supplementation with it as well. Number 4: Heavy metals Examples of heavy metals that can be found in tap water and are worth mentioning are : mercury, lead and aluminum. You are probably familiar with the dangers of lead and mercury such as kidney failure and low IQ in children, but one thing that’s overlooked a lot of times is aluminum. Aluminum is pretty dangerous and can increase the risk of : Parkinson’s, brain deformities, dementia and Alzheimer’s at a pretty severe level. Heavy metals, despite what studies say, are commonly leaked into tap water and seafood. This is one of the reasons many people have benefited from zeolites and ALA. (Be careful with both of them as we said). ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",394
Page 183,"Number 5: Herbicides and pesticides If these things keep away and sometimes kill insects and plants, it’s fairly safe to say that they can cause damage to our health also. These things destroy our soil, health, cause allergies, lower testosterone and bladder cancer. Various studies have demonstrated a higher risk of prostate cancer in agricultural populations than in the general population, especially the ones exposed to chlordecone (organochlorine pesticide). If you have a wife and she’s breastfeeding, please do your best to avoid pesticides and herbicides in the house (by filtering your drinking and showering water, avoiding wheat and rice, peeling the peel off your fruits and sticking to organic greens) since a significant amount gets passed through breastmilk. And if the first food you give to a kid is poisoned, his health might not turn out as good as it could. Number 6: Antidepressants, birth control and other medications If you’re not filtering your drinking water you’re basically on meds. Every kind of pharmaceutical drug gets leaked in water sources. One common pharmaceutical that’s being leaked in water sources is birth control pills. A five year usage of birth control pills doubles the chances of cervical cancer, increases breast cancer, massively lowers fertility, shrinks ovaries and increases the chance of birth defects in children. Also even though it is not exactly a med diethyl phthalate is a colorless liquid typically used to make flexible plastics which can sneak into groundwater from landfill leaks and drinking tap water contaminated with diethyl phthalate can lower sperm quality and count, disrupt sex hormone levels, and alter genital developments. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",350
Page 184,"We don’t need to mention the side effects of consuming polluted antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Number 7: Nitrates Nitrates severely damage your health and you should try your best to avoid them if your health is not where you want it to be. Nitrates among other things are the reason why you should also not consume processed meat since they’re loaded with them. Nitrates can affect how the blood carries oxygen and can turn hemoglobin (the protein in blood that carries oxygen) into methemoglobin. High levels of it can turn skin to a bluish or gray color and cause more serious health effects like weakness, excess heart rate, fatigue, and dizziness. Number 8: Radon Radon is the number one cause of lung cancer among non-smokers, according to EPA estimates. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer and is responsible for about 21,000 lung cancer deaths every year. Radon is a radioactive gas that occurs naturally when the uranium in soil and rock breaks down. It is invisible, odorless and tasteless. If your tap water has radon, you may be at risk of stomach cancer or internal organ cancers. Number 9: E coli O157:H7 E. coli, is a member of a group of organisms known as coliforms: common bacteria found in the digestive system of humans and animals. This organism is usually not a cause for concern, as there are only a few strains that cause serious disease in humans. One of these strains is responsible for causing Traveler's diarrhea, and the second is E. coli O157:H7, which contaminates meat and leafy vegetables. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",351
Page 185,"This strain (O157:H7) can cause serious hemorrhagic diarrhea and can have long term, if not fatal, complications. Unfortunately the tap water in a lot of places can contain E coli O157:H7. Number 10: Phosphates These are compounds of phosphate ions commonly present in fertilizers as plant nutrients and in detergents as a water softener. The presence of phosphates in water promotes excessive algae growth that makes the water dirty when algae die. Phosphates enter water systems when dissolved rocks mix into groundwater. High levels of phosphates in the body can put people at high risk of hardened arterial walls. Number 11: Dioxins Dioxins are toxic chemicals not produced or commercially used in the country. They are contaminants produced in combustion processes, like cigarette smoking and forest fire, and discharges from chemical factories. When released in the environment, these chemicals linger around so that we can breathe them in the air or drink them from tap water. Excess amounts of dioxins can cause reproductive difficulties and increase the risk of developing cancer when consumed in tap water for a long period. Number 12: Nearby chemical plants can contaminate your water If you live near chemical plants, refineries, or other industries, chemicals can contaminate drinking water. According to the Center for Public Integrity, manufacturing plants, mining and waste disposal companies have been contaminating the water supply across the country for decades. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",302
Page 186,"A 2013 study by the National Research Council found that there were over 126,000 plants throughout the country that tested positive for groundwater pollution. So, if you don’t filter your drinking water, every morning you're basically drinking heavy metals, fluoride, pesticides, herbicides, antidepressants, birth control pills, antibiotics and a trillion other poisons. No wonder why people are sick. Invest in a reverse osmosis filter or get any kind of filter if you can’t afford a reverse osmosis. It will have a positive impact on your health and the way you feel. Xenoestrogen detox 1. Avoid as many sources of xenoestrogen as you can and switch to replace them with natural alternatives. From plastic bottles, PUFAs and teflon pans all the way to tap water. 2. Sweat in the sauna 2-3 times a week in order to detox from endocrine disruptors like phthalates and BPA. 3. Try to incorporate some mild natural aromatase inhibitors in your diet such as: -Citrus fruits (or anything that contains naringenin) -Chamomile -Olive oil (and olives) -Palm kernel oil -Mushrooms 4. Get enough beta carotene and vitamin A from whole foods such as pumpkin, carrots and beef liver since retinol can aid in bisphenol-A detoxification. Carrots will also help bind excess estrogens in the gut preventing their reabsorption. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",321
Page 187,"5. 250 mg of vitamin C almost daily for a month. 6. Increase your fiber intake from sources such as raw carrots in between meals since excess xenoestrogen binds to fiber and it is eliminated through bowels. 7. Don’t forget that you can support liver detoxification either with ALA (personal favorite) or NAC for a short period of time to support glutathione (an antioxidant found in the liver and responsible for detoxification but also thyroid hormone conversion). A trick to make the effects of these 2 way more powerful is to consume ALA or NAC with bone broth since glutathione is dependent on glycine, cysteine, and glutamine. Do not ignore the phrase “short period of time” since our body is able recycle glutathione pretty well. What does “short term” mean exactly? Anything from supplementing ALA or NAC 2 times a week for 3-4 weeks in total, to 4-5 times a week for 2-3 weeks in total. Obviously you can support your liver detoxification with foods high in sulfur such as onion and garlic. Don’t skip the free range egg yolks and quality meats also since B vitamins and choline are crucial for your liver’s detoxification processes. 8. Activated charcoal (and the other binders that were mentioned on the heavy metal detox) that binds to xenoestrogens and dead bacteria besides endotoxins. Do not take more than 1-3 grams. 9. Boron Boron is a trace mineral which will displace fluoride from the glands and lower calcification of the soft tissue. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",350
Page 188,"6mg per day seems to be the ideal number for supplementing for up to 4 weeks and from there on prunes and raisins seem to provide enough amounts. 10. Provide the right nutrients that will help your liver detoxify xenoestrogens. This is a two part process that happens in the liver. In order to support the first part, you will need to optimize glutathione as demonstrated on the thyroid health chapter, provide enough B vitamins through an animal based diet (see lesson 2) and brewer’s yeast, keep the beta carotene at high doses and perhaps supplement with milk thistle as well. In order to support the second part, you will need bone marrow for glutamine, eggs for choline, magnesium glycinate, vitamin C rich foods and perhaps taurine supplementation. The total cost by the way of most of the supplements that were mentioned here for 2-3 months will vary from 60-150$ depending on where you live. 11. Last reminder to not skip on vitamin E rich foods. Many of the side effects of estrogen can be offset by vitamin E but estrogen increases the body’s needs for vitamin E as well. This is the end for lesson 1. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",260
