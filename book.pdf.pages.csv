Page 34,"Module 1.1: Cellular respirationThe first step in helping the body detox from various health harming compoundsthat are present in copious amounts in today’s society and heal from theirnegative effects, is focusing on optimizing one’s metabolism.It does not matter what your current health struggles might be.It does not matter if you entered this course to improve depression, anxiety, lowlibido, hair loss, hair thinning, gray hair, wrinkles, struggling to put on lean musclemass, struggling to lose fat, sleep problems, digestive issues, low testosterone,migraines, ADD, ADHD, chronic fatigue, migraines, epilepsy, problems with youreye vision, productivity problems, thyroid problems or fertility.Everything is connected with our metabolic health and if we don’t focus onoptimizing it, it will be like putting on bandaids.The first step in improving every health condition is understanding the basicprinciples of metabolic health and how to optimize it.This will not be a short journey but it will provide you with the tools you need inorder to transform your health once and for all but also your life as a direct resultof this.*Standard disclaimer that this does not constitute medical advice*Metabolism is defined as the whole range of biochemical processes that occurwithin a living organism and it constitutes the two processes of anabolism (buildup) and catabolism (break down).In simpler terms, metabolism refers to the body’s complex process of energyexpenditure or how our bodies convert calories into energy that enables us tofunction.So things such as: our digestive system, endocrine system, immune system,methylation track and in general every biological process that happens in ourbodies is part of our metabolism.So, the term metabolism is referring to the overall chemical reactions that occurin an organism.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",393
Page 35,"The term metabolic rate is referring to the frequency of the metabolic pathways.So it refers to the amount of energy that is used by an organism to maintain lifeprocesses.On a cellular level, the health of mitochondria is what determines the health ofone’s metabolism.Think of it this way: all the food we eat needs to be converted into energy that ourbody can use to keep on living.Mitochondria perform the first step in this extremely important process.Mitochondria are complex organelles that play a central role in energymetabolism, control of stress responses and are a hub for biosyntheticprocesses.Mitochondria have multiple functions within the cell that include ATP-production,calcium signaling, and apoptosis.So beyond their well established role in cellular energetics, mitochondria arecritical mediators of signals to propagate various cellular outcomes.They are membrane-bound cell organelles that generate most of the chemicalenergy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions. Chemical energyproduced by the mitochondria is stored in a small molecule called adenosinetriphosphate (ATP) which the cell can use as an energy source. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",254
Page 36,"Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell so to speak since they produceapproximately 90% of the ATP.Production of ATP requires 2 major steps.1) Oxidation of NADH (NADH stands for ""nicotinamideadenine dinucleotide(NAD) + hydrogen (H)"")and2)Phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP (oxidative phosphorylation [OXPHOS]).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",100
Page 37,"These 2 reactions are coupled in mitochondria, and OXPHOS is an efficient andenergy-conserving way of producing energy in aerobic organisms.NADH or FADH2 are generated during glucose metabolism via glycolysis and thetricarboxylic acid cycle or β-oxidation of fatty acids.NADH or FADH2 are oxidized to NAD+ or FAD while protons are pumped to theintermitochondrial membrane through respiratory complexes I, III, and IV. The synthesis of ATP is done through the citric acid cyclewhich usesglucose, pyruvate and NADH as the input molecules.Before we talk about the citric acid cycle, we need to talk about glycolysis andpyruvate oxidationwhichis the step between glycolysisand the citric acidcycle.Glycolysisoccurs in the cytoplasm and is one methodthat cells use to produceenergy in which glucose is partially broken down by cells in enzyme reactionsthat do not need oxygen and is the first step in the breakdown of glucose toextract energy for cellular metabolism.Note: Keep in mind that glycolysis provides less energy than oxidation provides alot of the time.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",270
Page 38,"Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway (a linked series of chemical reactions occurringwithin a cell) that even bacteria and viruses have. For example, the medicationsand supplements that are safe and effective for fighting viruses such as aspirin(more about aspirin and how to properly use it later) affect how the viruses induceaerobic glycolysis and lactate production. Glycolysis is a series of reactions that extract energy from glucose by splitting itinto two three-carbon molecules called pyruvates.The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energymolecules adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced nicotinamide adeninedinucleotide (NADH).In anaerobic conditions pyruvate is converted to lactic acid and this is why eventhough glycolysis provides some usable energy, it provides less than oxidationprovides.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",200
Page 39,"The chemical process in which oxygen is used to make energy fromcarbohydrates on the other hand is calledoxidative metabolismor aerobicmetabolism.By inhibitingexcessiveglycolysis, through a varietyof means that we will see inthis lesson, you dramatically improve oxidative metabolism and metabolic healthas a result of this.This will be a key driver of cell differentiation and protect us against diseases likecancer since OXPHOS deficiency is a characteristic of all cancer cells.The mitochondria of cancer cells consume rather than produce ATP. The sourceof that ATP is most likely the upregulated glycolysis which is another hallmark ofall cancer cells. So, in a sense, cancer cells have a very high rate of ""futile""metabolism and they consume ATP in order to grow and multiply, instead ofcontributing to the healthy (OXPHOS) process of producing energy. For example,dichloroacetate is effective against a variety of cancers and it acts by reactivatingthe enzymes that oxidize pyruvic acid since the ability of the mitochondria tooxidize pyruvic acid (and glucose) is characteristically lostto some degreeincancer.OXPHOS, is also very very crucial for our brain health as well since it’s involvedin neuronal development, connectivity, plasticity, and differentiation.Impairments in OXPHOS have been described in different general andpsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia.A Major function of OXPHOS is to consume NADH and recycle NAD+ to reduce“reductive stress” and provide electron acceptors for aspartate synthesis.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",350
Page 40,"Thus OXPHOS defects will not only cause reduction in ATP production but alsodecrease the production of aspartate which is a limiting metabolite for cellproliferation.Mitochondria and the OXPHOS are not only responsible for production ofhigh-energy phosphates, such as ATP and phosphocreatine, but are alsoinvolved in a variety of cellular processes, including calcium homeostasis,cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, inflammation, reactive oxygen species(ROS) production, and apoptosis.Therefore, it is not surprising that multifaceted OXPHOS dysfunctions, originatingfrom both genetic (maternal, or mendelian inheritance) and environmentalinfluences, have been reported in many diseases and disorders, includingneuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases,schizophrenia (SCZ), and bipolar disorder. (Pyruvic acid also has brain protectiveeffects through its decarboxylation).Now let’s talk about pyruvic oxidation.Pyruvic acid (CH3COCOOH) is the simplest of the alpha-ketoacids, with acarboxylic acid and a ketone functional group.The conjugate base, CH3COCOO−, is an intermediatein several metabolicpathways throughout the cell. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",292
Page 41,"Pyruvic acid can be made from glucose through glycolysis, converted back tocarbohydrates (such as glucose) via gluconeogenesis, or to fatty acids through areaction with acetyl-CoA. It can also be used to construct the amino acid alanine and can be converted intoethanol or lactic acid viafermentation.It supplies energy to cells through the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebscycle) when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and alternatively ferments toproduce lactate when oxygen is lacking.(*) Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that takes place in the cytosol of cells in allliving organisms.In pyruvic oxidation, we are starting with a molecule of pyruvate which has 3carbons.Then, we’ll make a molecule of acetyl by dropping a carbon and the carbon thatis lost will be lost as a molecule of CO2.All of these carbon have high energy electrons in their orbitals.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",222
Page 42,"NAD will take the electron that became available through the above process forus to utilize and since it now has an electron on it, it becomes NADH.So NADH is the product and NAD the reactant.Now acetyl’s destination is the mitochondria. In order for this to happen, CoA willbind to acetyl and is going to produce acetyl-CoA which can now be accepted bythe membrane of the mitochondria and now we can start the next step which isthe citric acid cycle. So, pyruvic acid supplies energy to cells through the citric acid cycle (Krebscycle) when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and alternatively ferments toproduce lactate when oxygen is lacking.A pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, will cause lactic acid to accumulate in theblood, it can damage the body's organs and particularly the nervous system.In aerobic conditions, the process converts one molecule of glucose into twomolecules of pyruvate (pyruvic acid), generating energy in the form of two netmolecules of ATP.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",243
Page 43,"Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced, but two are consumedas part of the preparatory phase.The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity(decrease its stability) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvatemolecules by the enzyme aldolase.During the pay-off phase of glycolysis, four phosphate groups are transferred toADP by substrate-level phosphorylation to make four ATP, and two NADH areproduced when the pyruvate is oxidized. The overall reaction can be expressed this way:Glucose + 2 NAD++ 2 Pi+ 2 ADP → 2 pyruvate + 2 H++ 2 NADH + 2 ATP + 2 H++ 2 H2O + energyⒸHelios_Movement LLC",177
Page 44,"Starting with glucose, 1 ATP is used to donate a phosphate to glucose to produceglucose 6-phosphate.Glycogen can be converted into glucose 6-phosphate as well with the help ofglycogen phosphorylase.During energy metabolism, glucose 6-phosphate becomes fructose 6-phosphate.An additional ATP is used to phosphorylate fructose 6-phosphate into fructose1,6-bisphosphate by the help of phosphofructokinase.Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate then splits into two phosphorylated molecules withthree carbon chains which later degrades into pyruvate. Moving on to the citric acid cycle.The citric acid cycle (or else known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle or the Krebs’cycle) is the major energy yielding metabolic pathway in cells, it is an importantpart of aerobic respiration and takes place in the matrix of the mitochondria (justlike the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",232
Page 45,"In order for ATP to be produced through oxidative phosphorylation, electrons arerequired for ATP to pass down the electron transport chain.These electrons come from electron carriers such as NADH and FADH, which areproduced by the citric acid cycle .The citric acid cycle harnesses the available chemical energy of acetyl coenzymeA (acetyl CoA) into the reducing power of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide(NADH).Here are some of the basic steps of the cycle.●Step 1:The cycle begins with an enzymatic aldoladdition reaction ofacetyl CoA to oxaloacetate, forming citrate which is isomerized by adehydration-hydration sequence to yield (2R,3S)-isocitrate.●Step 2: Citrate is converted to isocitrate .●Step 3: Isocitrate is oxidized to alpha-ketoglutarate which results in therelease of carbon dioxide. One NADH molecule is then formed.●Step 4: Alpha-ketoglutarate is oxidized to form a 4 carbon molecule inorder to bind to coenzyme A, forming succinyl CoA. A second molecule ofNADH and CO2 are then being produced.●Step 5: Succinyl CoA is then converted to succinate and one GTPmolecule is produced.●Step 6: Succinate is converted into fumarate and a molecule of FADH isproduced.●Step 7: Fumarate is converted to malate.●Step 8: Malate is then converted into oxaloacetate.●The third molecule of NADH is also produced.So, the products of the first turn of the cycle are one ATP, three NADH, oneFADH2and two CO2.The total number of ATP molecules obtained after complete oxidation of oneglucose in glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation is estimatedto be between 30 and 38.Note:Calcium is also used as a regulator in the citric acid cycle. Calcium levels inthe mitochondrial matrix can reach up to the tens of micromolar levels duringcellular activation.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",473
Page 46,"This short discussion about cellular respiration was done in order to introduceyou to the concept of anti-metabolic and pro-metabolic compounds.Module 1.2: Anti-metabolic and pro-metabolic compoundsUsing our common sense we very quickly arrive to the realization that we need toknow which compounds harm our metabolic health and which ones promote it, inorder to avoid the first and include the second. Let’s start with theanti-metaboliccompounds.Number 1: (Excessive) oxidative stressOxidative stress and mitochondrial damage have been implicated in thepathogenesis of every metabolic disease.Oxidative stress is characterized by the overproduction of reactive oxygenspecies (ROS), which can induce mitochondrial DNA mutations, damage themitochondrial respiratory chain, alter membrane permeability, and influence Ca2+homeostasis and mitochondrial defense systems. Calcium homeostasis refers to the maintenance of a constant concentration ofcalcium ions in the extracellular fluid.It includes all of the processes that contribute to maintaining calcium at its “setpoint.”ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",236
Page 47,"Because plasma [Ca2+] rapidly equilibrates with the extracellular fluid, ECF[Ca2+] is kept constant by keeping the plasma [Ca2+] constant.Maintaining a constant plasma [Ca2+] is important for things such as nervetransmission and conduction, cardigan contractility, blood clotting,cell to celladhesionand of course bone formation.Now all the changes that were mentioned at the top of this page, are implicated inthe development of metabolic diseases.A free radical attack occurs directly at complexes in the mitochondrial respiratorychain.Mitochondria are normally protected from oxidative damage by a multilayernetwork of mitochondrial antioxidant systems which consist of superoxidedismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase togetherwith a number of low molecular weight antioxidants such as α-tocopherol andubiquinol.These molecules are particularly effective in scavenging lipid peroxyl radicals andpreventing free radical chain reactions of lipid peroxidation.Cumulative oxidative injuries to mitochondria, triggered by endogenous metabolicprocesses and/or exogenous oxidative influences, cause mitochondria toprogressively become less efficient.As mitochondria progressively lose their functional integrity, ever-greaterproportions of oxygen molecules reaching them are converted to ROS.So the numerous and disparate mitochondrial functions include the synthesis ofmost of the ATP present in the cell, apoptosis, ion homeostasis, cellular stressresponse, antioxidant control, redox regulation, mitophagy and the involvement invarious biosynthetic pathways.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",344
Page 48,"Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radicalproduction and their detoxification. Free radicals are unstable compounds that lead to cell destruction and chronicinflammation.An atom or group of atoms with an unpaired electron is called a freeradical.So a free radical can be defined as any molecular species capable ofindependent existence that contains an unpaired electron in an atomic orbital.A free radical is a molecule with an unpaired electron. It can steal electrons froma stable molecule, creating a new free radical and initiating a chain reaction.This electron-grabbing is calledoxidationand canset up a chain reaction,creating new free radicals and damaging important molecules along the way,similar to how one falling domino can bring down countless more.Antioxidants are molecules that can donate an electron to stabilize andneutralize free radicals.An antioxidant can stop the free radical chain reaction in its tracks by donating anelectron and then the antioxidant itself becomes a free radical.Byt antioxidants are not very reactive themselves and have processes for quickstabilization.Free radicals are a natural byproduct of metabolic reactions and of exercise, andit’s normal to have low levels of free radicals in the body.With enough antioxidants present, free radicals can be kept in check so that theyaren’t dangerous.However,too many free radicals and not enough protectionfromantioxidants creates a situation called oxidative stress.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",302
Page 49,"Free radical development is unavoidable, but human bodies have adapted bysetting up and maintaining defense mechanisms that reduce their impact.The body’s two major defense systems are free radical detoxifying enzymesand antioxidants.Free radical detoxifying enzyme systems are responsible for protecting theinsides of cells from free radical damage.An antioxidant is any molecule that can block free radicals from stealingelectrons. antioxidants act both inside and outside of cells.The three major enzyme systems and the chemical reactions they catalyze are:1.Superoxide Dismutases (SOD). They are essential forfree radicaldetoxification and these enzymes either have manganese, copper or zincas a cofactor.2.Catalase.These enzymes convert hydrogen peroxideto water and oxygenand finish the detoxification process that SOD starts. This enzyme containsiron as a cofactor but since iron can be tricky, don’t simply start upping thehigh iron foods in order to boost catalase enzymes.3.Glutathione Peroxidases.These selenium dependentenzymes alsoconvert hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen.Antioxidants are broadly classified as either hydrophilic (water soluble) orhydrophobic (lipid soluble), and this classification determines where they act inthe body.Hydrophilic antioxidants act in the cytosol of cells or in extracellular fluids such asblood, hydrophobic antioxidants are largely responsible for protecting cellmembranes from free radical damage.The body can synthesize some antioxidants, but others must be obtained fromthe diet.There are two antioxidants that the body synthesizes.1) Glutathione, which contains a sulfur group thatcan donate an electron to afree radical, thereby stabilizing it.2) Uric acidwhich is too high of a concentrationcan cause gout.There are many different antioxidants in food as well.Antioxidant vitamins(Vitamin E, Vitamin C) donatetheir electrons to freeradicals to stabilize them.Antioxidant phytochemicals(beta-carotene and othercarotenoids) may inhibitthe oxidation of lipids or donate electrons.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",456
Page 50,"Antioxidant mineralsact as cofactors within complex antioxidant enzymesystems (superoxide dismutases, catalase, glutathione peroxidases describedearlier) to convert free radicals to less damaging substances that can beexcreted.Vitamin ESources:EVOO, red palm oil, low dose (20mg) of supplementalvitamin Ecoming from red palm oil (doses higher than 20mg of vitamin E will deplete otherfat soluble vitamins very fast) and palm kernel oil.Functions:Protects cellular membranes and preventsglutathione depletion.When we talk about vitamin E, we’re actually referring to 8 chemically similarsubstances, of whichalpha-tocopherol appears to bethe most potentantioxidants.Because vitamin E is fat-soluble, its antioxidant capacity is especially important tolipids, including those in cell membranes and lipoproteins.For example, free radicals can oxidize LDL cholesterol (stealing an electron fromit), and it is this damaged LDL that lodges in blood vessels and forms the fattyplaques characteristic of atherosclerosis, increasing the risk of heart attack,stroke, and other complications of cardiovascular disease.After alpha-tocopherol interacts with a free radical it is no longer capable of actingas an antioxidant unless it is enzymatically regenerated.Vitamin E, mainly as alpha-tocopherol, plays a role in the immune system,regulation of gene expression, and cell signaling.It also enhances the dilation of blood vessels and inhibits blood clot formation.Vitamin E can be destroyed at high temperatures,sothings such as sunflowerand soybean oil are of course not a good vitamin E source.Vitamin CSources:Berries (preferably wild berries), camu camu,acerola cherries, kiwis,grapefruit juice with no pulp and orange juice with no pulp.These foods should not be paired with foods high in iron since this increasesoxidative stress (more about unbound iron later).Function:Protects DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids andaids in regeneratingvitamin E.Vitamin C, is a water-soluble vitamin essential in the diet for humans.Interestingly, most other mammals can readily synthesize vitamin C and don’trequire it in their diets.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",496
Page 51,"Vitamin C’s ability to easily donate electrons makes it a highly effectiveantioxidant.Since it is water-soluble, it acts both inside and outside cells to protect moleculesin aqueous environments.Vitamin C also plays a vital role in regenerating vitamin E after it has acted as anantioxidant, allowing it to be recycled and used again. After vitamin E donates an electron to neutralize a free radical, it can beregenerated by an electron from vitamin C.Vitamin C is then regenerated by antioxidant enzymes.In addition to its role as an antioxidant, vitamin C is a required part of severalenzymes involved in the synthesis ofcollagen, a proteinimportant to thestrength and structure of muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments, connective tissue,and skin.SeleniumSources:Shellfish, organs, eggsFunction:Cofactor of free radical detoxifying enzymes,maintains glutathionelevels, aids in regeneration of vitamins C and E.Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is part of the structure of at least 25proteins in the body with functions in thyroid hormone metabolism, DNAsynthesis, reproduction and protecting the immune system.As part of antioxidant enzymes, selenium helps to regenerate other antioxidants,including vitamin C.These enzymes also protect lipids from free radicals, and, in doing so, sparevitamin E.This also illustrates how antioxidants work together to protect the body againstfree radical-induced damage.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",318
Page 52,"And last but not least, we have:carotenoidsfrom sources such as pumpkin,squash, peaches, apricots and carrot juice which function as free radicalscavengers.Electrons can act as powerful antioxidants as well.A very effective and free tool that will greatly reduce oxidative stress is groundingor as often is referred to as “earthing”.The earth contains an endless supply of electrons which can be used in order toneutralize free radicals in the body.Connecting our bodies to the earth (especially during sleep with means such asgrounding sheets (sounds crazy but it works) normalizes the daily cortisol rhythm,improves sleep, leads to reductions in pain, inflammation and increases themetabolic rate.This happens since the surface of the earth possesses a limitless andcontinuously renewed supply of free or mobile electrons as a consequence of aglobal atmospheric electric circuit.A direct earth connection enables both diurnal electrical rhythms are freeelectrons to flow from the earth to the body and neutralize the positively chargedfree radicals that are the hallmark of chronic inflammation as we just saw.So free electrons from the earth can resolve chronic inflammation by serving asnatural antioxidants.Again, free radicals are not evil in a binary manner.Free radicals to a degree are needed for optimal health when derived fromnormal essential metabolic processes in the human body.For example, the immune system uses the cell-damaging properties of freeradicals to kill pathogens.First, immune cells engulf an invader, then they expose it to free radicals such ashydrogen peroxide, which destroys its membrane and the invader is thusneutralized.Free radicals are necessary for many other bodily functions as well.The body creates free radicals through the normal processes of metabolism (i.e.,turning food into usable energy/ATP).When the amount of free radicals exceeds the body’s ability to eliminate orneutralize them, an oxidative imbalance results.Substances and energy sources from the environment can add to or acceleratethe production of free radicals within the body.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",434
Page 53,"Excessive exposure to environmental sources of free radicals is whatcontributes to diseaseby overwhelming the free radicaldetoxifying systemsand those processes involved in repairing oxidative damage.So the problem starts when ROS are derived from external sources such assmoking, nnEMF, heavy metals, stress, air pollutants, X-Rays, bad food choicesand so on.Free radical formation occurs continuously in the cells as a consequence of bothenzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions.Bullet points on how to battle oxidative stress effectively.Number 1:Providing components such as selenium,vitamin C, beta carotene,vitamin E and sulfur in balanced quantities to our body through our diet.Number 2:Not neglecting the fat soluble vitaminsA and K which are critical forour bodies to be able to utilize the above dietary antioxidants better but they alsohave some antioxidant properties on their own.Number 3:Grounding as much as possible during theday and avoidunnecessary sources of nnEMF.Number 4:Restoring the mineral balance (see heavymetal detox).Number 5:Detoxing from heavy metals (see heavy metaldetox).Number 6:Support glutathione.Glutathione is made mainly from three amino acids: glycine, cysteine, andglutamine, and has the major function of protecting the mitochondria againstoxidative stress.In order to boost glutathione production:1)Consume sulfur rich foodssuch as fish, beef, onions,garlic, shallots andorganic broccoli once in a while after you’ve healed your gut.2)Consume vitamin C and E rich foods.Vitamin C maintainsthe body’s supplyof antioxidants, including glutathione and helps reprocess glutathione byconverting oxidized glutathione back to its active form.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",396
Page 54,"3)Consume selenium rich foods.Selenium is a glutathione cofactor, meaningit’s a substance needed for glutathione activity and will lead to increasedglutathione peroxidase levels.4)Start adding turmeric in your meals once in a while.Numerous animal andtest-tube studies have shown that turmeric and curcumin extract have the abilityto increase glutathione levels. Just make sure to add some black pepper toturmeric to help the absorption.5)Consume the rest of the important nutrients that our body needs to makeand recycle glutathione which are:magnesium, zinc,B vitamins, glycine andglutamine which can all be found in animal products such as organs, oysters, freerange eggs and bone marrow.Note: Short term glycine supplementation post workoutcan also help boostglutathione. Number 7:Tools to use under sickness (extreme inflammatorystates) and underover exposure to environmental pollutants (if for example you live in a huge city).Tool 1:NAC taken with a meal that has a small amount(20-30 grams) of beefliver since NAC can deplete you of copper fast, but also bi weekly oysters insteadof weekly, since it can also deplete you of zinc.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",284
Page 55,"NAC should be used as a short term toll with the main uses of: brain support,lung support, liver support, kidney support, glutathione support and reducingcortisol.Tool 2:Cacao.Cacao has even up to 50 times more antioxidant capacity than berries if it’sorganic.

Page 65,"Stress will of course raise cortisol and adrenaline which lead to excessivemetabolism of protective hormones such as progesterone through (partly) theprogesterone steal.Stress inevitably leads to a deficiency of all of the steroid protective hormones.Stress and ROS are very connected so when you find yourself under situations ofextreme stress it will be very useful to re-read that part.Avoiding alcohol, getting plenty of sleep, not fasting extensively (daily fasting formore than 12-14 hours), plenty of grounding, optimizing GABA as it will bedemonstrated on the next module, minimizing exposure to nnEMF, balancing theamino acid profile of one’s diet as will be demonstrated in lesson2, not followingextreme diets and making sure that one does not over-exercise(*) in order to nottrigger the production of too much lactic acid (if you live your workouts burn out,you overdid it), making sure that you get enough magnesium, bioavailableprotein, zinc and glycine will all be crucial in order to restore metabolic health bylowering stress hormones.Glycine modulates the cytokines that are involved in many inflammatory diseasesand will also help you manage NO production.(*)The fatigue produced by over training is produced by a tryptophan andserotonin overload both of which are anti-metabolic.It’s better to break yourworkouts into more sessions with less volume, than it is to burn yourself out.Number 8:(Excessive) lactic acidLactic acid reduces oxidative production of energy (it inhibits pyruvatedehydrogenase) and is involved in the degradation of mitochondria. In fact, lacticacid can be so anti-metabolic that it can be considered as one of the main driversof cancer since high lactate generation is commonly seen in cancer cells andtumors.Lactic acid also has opposite effects to the protective CO2 and lactic acid buildupcan even trigger seizures, heart failure (excessive lactic acid ages the heart andⒸHelios_Movement LLC",432

This meal is extremely effective for preventing lacticacid build up and improving your performance. You will notice the benefits fromthe first session (do not skip the coconut oil).Thiamine prevents lactic acid build up (*) and coconut oil contains palmitic acidwhich activates a respiratory enzyme which suppresses the formation of lacticacid.(*) Taking thiamine is a treatment for lactic acidosis but also generally helps toreduce lactic acid production when the individual is under stress and promotesnormal cellular respirationStep 3:Optimize thyroid performance (full protocolin this lesson).Step 4:Short term biotin supplementation.Excess lactic acid can be “treated” by poisoning glycolysis by using dichloroaceticacid and increasing the oxidation of glucose.Well, things such as thiamine, biotin and thyroid, increase the oxidation ofglucose as well but way more safer and more effectively.This is why a B vitamin deficiency is directly linked to lactic acidosis.Step 5:No fermented foods(this includes beer).Some beers purposely contain lactic acid such as the Belgianlambics.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",361

Once a little after sunrise, once midday and oncea little before sunset.Number 9:Tryptophan , cysteine and an unbalancedamino acid profileEverything else that we have discussed so far (even the concept that serotonin issomething bad when in excess and someone actually needs a very small amountof it in order for his intestines to be healthy, but also, that estrogen is a stresshormone and progesterone is the actual female hormone), can be linked back tovarious researchers and people like Otto,KatherinaDaltonandSzent-Gyorgyi.But when it comes to the concept of balancing amino acids, we need to givecredits to Ray.Ray pointed out (or at least popularized) that tryptophan and cysteine inhibitthyroid function, mitochondrial energy production and decrease one’s ability towithstand stress partly as a result of that.Ray has contributed of course to the understanding of many pro-metabolic andanti-metabolic concepts as well and his work is very valuable if one can interpretit right.In fact, i can even say that the first lesson might even be such an attempt by alsocombining the works of other great people and some recent studies.Studying Ray will not provide you with a prescription like solution but he’s a greatguy and you should check his work if you have the time.One reason why the amino acid tryptophan can be considered as anti-metabolic,is because it is the precursor to serotonin.When serotonin is concentrated in high doses, it causes severe inflammationwhich can lead to immunosuppression and neurological damage.Ray points out that restricting only tryptophan or only cysteine produces a greaterextension of the life span than achieved in most of the studies of caloricrestriction and if you go down that rabbit it checks out.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",487
Page 68,"Why could this be the case? Well, one of the reasons why it’s probably becausethey throw the methionine:glycine ratio out of balance which can have manynegative effects such as even depleting someone of copper.This is why for example a lot of people’s premature white hair improve afterstarting balancing the amino acid profile in their diets, it is because the depletionof copper is one of the causes of premature white hair and balancing the aminoacids can prevent this to some extent.Our bodies got adapted into getting every amino acid that an animal has to offersince we could not afford wasting any part of it.But in today’s society that we tend to eat too much muscle meat and little to noneorgan meats, bone marrow and the rest of the animal parts, the amino acid profileof our diets is nothing but balanced and when something gets out of balance inthe human body health problems will rise sooner or later.The average person literally consumes zero grams of glycine every day when weneed anywhere from 10-60 grams depending on our age and other things suchas copper status, electrolyte status and so on.This, first of all, harms our liver. Glycine is in fact a non essential amino acidwhich means that our body can create some glycine.But when the demands of glycine skyrocket due to the methionine ratio in ourdiets, the liver has to overwork in order to provide enough glycine.This is also a severely under-rated factor why stuttering in young kids is socommon nowadays. A severe imbalance between methionine and glycine, putsthe sympathetic nervous system on override and harms one’s nervous system ingeneral as well. (Every concept that is mentioned here, it doesn't matter if it’sglycine or stuttering, gets discussed in more detail in various parts of theprogram).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",406
Page 69,"Most people that have never consumed things such as bone marrow, bone broth,(quality) gelatin or have not supplement with glycine or things such asmagnesium glycinate, will benefit from incorporating some magnesium glycinate,bone marrow and bone broth coming from quality animals or if you want to bemore precise, for every 100-150 grams of non collagen animal protein (musclemeats), consumed 10 grams of 10 grams of (quality) collagen.A lot of people are also deficient in folate (don’t simply go and buy a bottle of folicacid), so excessive consumption of methionine will lead to elevated blood levelsof homocysteine which have been associated with several chronic conditions.If you really want to know the exact ratios of amino acids that are in yoursystem(*) , the best thing to do is ask your doctor for a plasma amino acids testbut these can be very expensive and almost never covered by insurance.(*)Again, if you have never eaten things such as bone marrow, bone broth,gelatin or have been supplemented with any form of glycine, it is very unlikelythat they are.Now let’s talk about thepro-metaboliccompounds.Number 1:ThyroidThe thyroid gland is so important for our metabolic health that there is an entirepart in this lesson which will make you understand its function, which things youshould test for and how to optimize the function of your thyroid.Optimizing thyroid performance is also one of the most undervalued butextremely effective ways of optimizing testosterone, DHT and lowering estrogenas well since thyroid upregulates all steroidogenic enzymes.We can not have optimal metabolic health without a healthy thyroid.Number 2:SunlightSimply by paying attention to nature and seeing that everything starts to flourishin spring and die in autumn, should give us a hint of how sunlight supports lifeand its expansion.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",397
Page 70,"But nowadays people are told to avoid the sun. They are told to avoid the thingthat gives life to everything on this planet, the thing that regulates our circadianrhythm and so every metabolic process, the thing that can double theirtestosterone levels and significantly improve insulin resistance (in modernenvironments if one is not getting any sunlight, the overexposure to blue light isenough to cause problems with glucose metabolism), researchers completelyignore a lot of the time that there are light-sensitive protein on fat cells, that a lackof sunlight suppresses thyroid hormone productions (and thus harms ourmetabolic health like very few things) and progesterone, they ignore that mostpeople are deficient in precious vitamin D which is also critical for our hormonalhealth and in general there is a lot of propaganda that is going on against thesun.It is in fact true that since our skin is made out of the things that we eat, if aperson’s diet consists of pro-inflammatory fats like vegetable oils, it ignores thehormetic effect of the sun (one must gradually build up to the amount that heexposes his skin to sunlight) and is contributing to the excess creation of ROS bydrinking alcohol on a regular basis, smoking and never grounding, he can ofcourse encounter skin cancer.But the sun by itself does not cause cancer and without daily exposure to evennatural light we can’t have a healthy metabolism.Note:Every topic that is discussed in the first 50pages, is an attempt to ease theindividual into certain ideas that will be discussed in more detail in other variousparts of the program. So a lot of questions that might be created while readingthis material are indeed addressed later.Number 3:B vitaminsDon’t forget that B vitamins are essential in the citric acid cycle.1) Thiamine (B1) is essential for TPP.2) Riboflavin (B2) is essential for FAD.3) Niacin (B3) is essential for NAD.4) Pantothenic acid is essential for CoA.The following graph demonstrates how each one of the B vitamins impactsenergy production.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",451
Page 71,"In any metabolic disease, it does not matter if it’s cancer or T2D, the ability ofmitochondria to oxidize sugar is lost to a degree. B vitamins are water solublevitamins that most people are deficient in nowadays (both due to a lack of them intheir diet, their depletion though means such as alcohol but also due toenvironmental factors such as stress) but they are necessary for glucosemetabolism. B vitamins such as B3 also support glucose metabolism by loweringfree fatty acid and further supporting sugar oxidation.How to properly restore B vitamins is properly addressed on the part of optimizingglucose metabolism.Number 4:ProgesteroneProgesterone is a hormone that has many important effects on carbohydrate, lipidand protein metabolism but also protects many vital organs and tissue.Progesterone is the actual female hormone and not estrogen. For example,estrogen can cause miscarriages while progesterone can greatly prevent them.We all have progesterone receptors so this hormone is not only important forwomen, in fact, a great part of testosterone is derived from progesterone.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",244
Page 72,"We have many progesterone receptors in our brain(*), lungs, liver, bones, skin,hair follicles, lungs and in case you are a woman, in the uterus.(*) There are progesterone receptors in the limbic area of the brain, which isresponsible for behavior and emotional responses. This is why a progesteronedeficiency which is very common in modern society since a lot of womenregularly consume estrogenic substances such as birth control pills, hascatastrophic effects on the mood of women.Progesterone also increases the synthesis of ceruloplasminwhich is the majorcopper-carrying protein in the blood and in addition plays a role in ironmetabolism. As we will see, unbound iron is a major contributor to many diseasesand the reason that people still suffer from problems which spring from unboundiron is a progesterone deficiency.Progesterone also has many anti-estrogenic effects all the way to even restoringone’s fertility, can prevent seizures, decalcify the tissues, improve hypothyroidismand lower PTH pretty fast since it redirects calcium where it is needed the most.Now how you can boost progesterone.First, make sure that you get enough sunlight multiple times a day since a lack ofsunlight will directly suppress progesterone. If it’s usually cloudy where you live,obviously still go outside since you need natural light in order to set yourcircadian rhythm and many biological processes and you can also use a rightlight device if you can afford it.Then, vitamin A and saturated fats such as coconut oil are essential in order forcholesterol to be converted to progesterone so the second step that you can doin order to make sure that the endogenous production of progesterone in notharmed, is eating some beef liver cooked on coconut oil once or twice a weekdepending on the dose (for the average person, 200-300 (tops) grams of beefliver per week are enough since vitamin A toxicity can be a real things undercertain conditions (for example an improper methionine:glycine ratio will greatlyimpact vitamin A toxicity)).When it comes to supplementing progesterone, typically, it is safer to start withpregnenolone first especially if you are a man.In order to safely supplement both there are 2 critical prerequisites.1)Make sure that you have enough vitamin A (retinol) in your system. This meansthat in case organ meats were not a part of your diet, you need to focus onⒸHelios_Movement LLC",543
Page 73,"consuming them (do not over do it) for 3-5 weeks before supplementing any ofthese.2) Make sure that you have enough calcium, its regulators (magnesium, vitaminD and vitamin K for the most part) and zinc in your system by following any dietplan that will be recommended in this program for 3-5 weeks.Then and only then you can try pregnenolone or progesterone (only use naturalprogesterone) in very small doses (always start with less of what a supplementor medication recommends).Both need to be cycles and dizziness is a sign that you overdid it.If you get dizzy/nauseated with even the smallest dose, you have enough in yoursystem.Number 5:CarbohydratesCarbohydrates are organic compounds that consist of carbon, oxygen, hydrogenandare pro metabolic.There are three main types of carbohydrates:1)Starches2)Fiber3)SugarsWe mostly like fructose, some specific types of fiber and very very few types ofstarch since they are the most pro metabolic.Carbohydrates also produce more CO2 than protein and fats and will bediscussed in more detail in lesson 2 with the other macronutrients, but vitaminsand minerals as well.So carbohydrates are pro-metabolic, however,whenwe increase metabolicactivity, we can exacerbate a nutritional and hormonal deficiencyand this iswhy so many people today are “carb intolerant”.They are not carb intolerant, they are malnourished.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",331
Page 74,"You can’t increase the metabolic activity and not experience side effects in caseyou are nutrient depleted. Replenish the nutrients first as you will see in thisprogram and reintroduce the right type of carbs as it will be demonstrated.Number 5:Saturated fatsCompounds such as stearic acid that can be found in saturated fats, promotemitochondrial fusion (mitochondrial fusion is necessary for cell survival and forthe movement of mitochondria within neurons).In modern society where PUFAs are so abundant, things such as coconut oil,grass fed tallow, ghee and butter (after you have addressed certain conditions),cocoa butter, raw goat’s milk and things of this nature are all critical componentsof a robust metabolic health.Not to mention that saturated fats have anti-serotonin and antihistamine effects.Number 6: Blackseed oilNot all seed oils are created equal, blackseed oil recycles NADH back to NAD+and can thus help correct the tryptophan-kynurenine pathway which we willmention in the module of glucose optimization.When shopping for blackseed oil, make sure that it is cold pressed but that also itdoes not include additives such as canola, sunflower, soybean and in generalinferior fats.Number 7:CO2Carbon dioxide can even directly help our body generate mitochondria (andstabilize them) so pay special attention to what you’re about to read in the nextmodule.Number 8:TaurineTaurine has been used for years to treat cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer disease,cardiovascular diseases, epilepsy, muscular degradation, hepatic disorders andin general prevent chronic inflammation in adipose tissue.Taurine also greatly supports glucose metabolism and if one’s metabolism is notat the condition that he would like, along with B vitamins, taurine can greatly helpwith restoring sugar oxidation.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",410
Page 75,"Taurine regulates the expression of insulin receptor IRS1 and glucose transportertype 4 (GLUT4) which are involved in the insulin signaling pathway and glucosemetabolism but it also regulates glucagon, and somatostatin.From successfully reducing triglycerides and unbound iron all the way topreventing obesity, taurine is a great overall supplement.In the case that someone breaks out (not in hives, small pimples) or he smellsfunny after taking thiamine or taurine, this is a sign of excess unbound iron(unbound iron is so dangerous that it is excreted through the skin in order to notdamage the organs) and needs to be immediately addressed as demonstrated onthe part of heavy metal detox.Taurine is so pro-metabolic that it greatly reduces LDL cholesterol as well withoutany of the negative effects that other cholesterol lowering substances can havesuch as beta glucan (beta glucan lowers testosterone and DHT).Number 9:Vitamin CVitamin C is crucial for the health of our endocrine system especially whensomeone is under stress. It carries out redox reactions, is crucial for ironhomeostasis, immune system and heart health, is linked to the metabolism ofglutathione and very few studies show that it can help restore OXPHOS.More about vitamin C later in this lesson and in lesson 2. For now, keep in mindthat adding foods in your diet such as berries, acerola cherry and camu camucould be a good idea for most people especially if you are living somewheresunny and are or used to be a smoker.Number 10:Fat soluble vitamins and CoQ10.These are the molecules besides the ones mentioned that can restore OXPHOSvery efficiently.We already briefly talked about the importance of vitamin E and A for ourmetabolic health.When it comes to vitamin K, it will greatly improve our gut health and ourmetabolic health as a result of that since endotoxins(*) are a source for disruptedoxidative metabolism.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",435
Page 76,"(*)Endotoxins are toxins located inside of bacteria and when released, theyinterfere with mitochondrial respiration, thyroid function, raise estrogen, nitricoxide, serotonin and lactic acid (well, lactate to be precise).Stress, working out fasted and constipation cause increased endotoxin leakagefrom the gut and absorption to the blood.When it comes to CoQ10 you might have heard about its heart protective effectsbut CoQ10 is an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transportchain as well (this is why it probably is one of the most undervalued lipid solubleantioxidants as well) but also plays a key role in mitochondrial oxidativephosphorylation.CoQ10 is also involved in the regeneration of the antioxidants vitamin C and Ebesides being a mediator of inflammation in general and plays a role incholesterol metabolism so a CoQ10 deficiency negatively affects steroidogenesis.This is one of the reasons why statins (cholesterol lowering drugs) can droptestosterone levels so fast (statins deplete CoQ10).CoQ10 has been shown to also significantly reduce HbA1c levels in type IIdiabetics.Number 11:GlycineWe briefly discussed glycine when discussing balancing amino acids. Glycine isan amazing and crucial amino acid (unless you are struggling with a bacterialovergrowth in which in most cases you need to stay away from its supplementalform for a while and stick to things such as bone marrow and perhaps grass fedcollagen) that has many benefits.Glycine protects our nervous system, lowers cytokines, NO, estrogen, mitigatesexcessive serotonin and inhibits lipolysis.Number 12:Methylene blueMethylene blue increases NAD/NADH ratio (one of the reasons why it was usedto treat schizophrenia), increases the number of mitochondria, is a greatantioxidant, it stimulates glucose metabolism and increases oxygen in brain cells.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",411
Page 77,"Methylene blue is a great metabolic enhancer but it obviously needs to be cycledsince it can increase acetylcholine too much after a certain point and causesevere anxiety. But in general, it is a great short term tool in order to restoreOXPHOS if one has the common sense to use a low dose, cycle it, usepharmacological grade and replenish B vitamins first.Number 13:AspirinAspirin stimulates mitochondrial respiration, can promote normal cell division,activates glycolysis, increases CO2 and has anti-estrogenic effects.Disclaimer: Aspirin is a very tricky substance in the modern day and agebecause: a) a lot of people have taken medication such as accutane whichoverload the pancreas and if they consume aspirin a lot of negative side effectscan be expected, b) the additives that aspirin contains have changed the lastyears and c)most people are deficient in vitamin K (both K1 and K2).So in order for someone to use aspirin he must first of all, replenish vitamin K(see lesson 2), dilute the aspirin in water in order for the additives to sit at thebottom of the glass and only the salicylic acid to be consumed and of course,focus on optimizing his gut health as will be demonstrated on this lesson first.Module 1.3: Optimize sleepDeep sleep helps the body generate more mitochondria and triggers themultiplication of stem cells.This is one of the reasons why lack of sleep damages our health very fast.Getting quality sleep on a daily basis is non negotiable for anyone who wants tooptimize his metabolic health.Any form of sleep disorder will cause metabolic harm and severely lowerandrogens.You can easily increase your testosterone for up to 200 ng/dL if you just optimizesleep.Besides this, routinely sleeping less than six hours doubles our risk forencountering cancer, which says a lot about the way sleep affects our metabolism(cancer is a metabolic disease).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",427
Page 78,"Inadequate sleep, even moderate reductions for just one week, disrupts bloodsugar levels so profoundly that you would be classified as pre-diabetic.HRR analysis showed that sleep deprivation affected mitochondrial bioenergeticscapacity, decreasing respiration at oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) andelectron transport system (ETS).In addition, the expression of genes involved in the response to oxidative stressand apoptosis were increased.Sleep is intricately connected to various hormonal and metabolic processes in thebody and is important in maintaining metabolic homeostasis.Many research has shown that sleep deprivation and sleep disorders haveprofound anti metabolic effects and a single night of insomnia is enough to shortterm decrease the metabolic rate by 25%.Sleep deprivation causes a lot of serious problems with the most commonones being:-Depression-Fatigue-Immune system dysfunction-Myocardial Infarct-Stroke-Insulin resistance-Vascular disease-Hypertension-Psychosis-Diabetes-Mood disorders-Obesity-Panic disorders-Anxiety-Neurological damage-Skin aging-Dark circlesⒸHelios_Movement LLC",239
Page 79,"-Vision problems-Estrogen dominance-Hypogonadism-Hair loss-Skin issuesIf you encounter any of the above, ask yourselves if your sleep is in optimalcondition.If someone told you that he invented a pill that can help you prevent all of theabove and makes you 3 times more productive, you would pay good money for it.Yet sleep is something completely free with the ability to transform your healthand every aspect of your life.It is more effective than any antidepressant, any diabetes medication, anynootropic, any anabolic steroid, any anti-aging cream or procedure, any fat losspeople, any testosterone booster and any gut healing supplement since evenshort term insomnia by itself can cause a leaky gut.So before grabbing that bone broth or kimchi for improving your gut health (whichis something counterproductive actually for a lot of people and we will see why)make sure to optimize your sleep.Optimizing sleep is the most effective jack of all trades when it comes toimproving any aspect of our physical and mental well being.If you don’t know what’s the first step in order to optimize every aspect of yourhealth, this is it.If you think that you are sleeping fine ask yourselves the following 3 questions:1)Can i sleep every night for 8 hours straight with no problem?ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",288
Page 80,"2)Do i have dreamless sleep? (Yes, dreamless)3)Do i wake up rejuvenated every morning?If the answer to any of this is no, then there’s room for improvement and theseare good news because it means that you can massively improve your healthcompletely for free.Now sleep is controlled by two processes: circadian and homeostatic. During waking hours, the sleep drive gradually increases until it reaches a criticalthreshold. This drive is referred to as homeostatic.Circadian rhythm, on the other hand, is a signal generated by the master clock,the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) located in the anterior hypothalamus.Circadian rhythm, derived from the Latin term“circadiem”which literally means“approximately one day” is the body's internal clock.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",186
Page 81,"This clock is set at slightly over 24 hours. It controls sleep as well as mostbiological processes, including hormone production, metabolism, core bodytemperature variations, and cell regeneration among others.This clock is normally highly synchronized to environmental cues (Zeitgebers,German for “time giver”), the strongest of them being the light-dark cycle.In most humans the alertness pattern shows a biphasic distribution, with amid-day decrease in alertness around 2–4 pm, followed by an increasedalertness during mid to late evening, and finally declining to its lowest levelsduring the night.Disturbance of this well-regulated circadian rhythm and homeostatic drive(circadian misalignment) can lead to various sleep disorders collectively knownas circadian rhythm sleep disorders.Shift work disorder is one of the circadian rhythm disorders which have been afocus of large epidemiological studies for its potential implications on health.A Swedish study followed shift workers for 15 years and reported increasedrelative risk for ischemic heart disease (RR = 2.8) as compared to daytimeworkers independent of smoking and age with similar socioeconomicbackground.More recent studies have suggested that shift work is the most significant sourceof ischemic heart disease accounting for over 10% of mortality in men and over5% in women. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",281
Page 82,"In a large cohort of subjects followed prospectively in the Nurse Health Study IIinvestigators found increased risk of type II diabetes in young and middle agenurses working in rotating night shift work.Cross-sectional data also suggests higher triglyceride levels, lower HDL levels,and more obesity in the shift workers than daytime workers.Circadian misalignment suggests its role, albeit unclear, in metabolicdysregulation. Since sleep deprivation is commonly associated with shift workdisorder further prospective trials adjusting for sleep deprivation are required toestablish the role of circadian misalignment as opposed to the indirect effect ofsleep deprivation on metabolic dysregulation.So, a lot of people today experience sleep problems and the problem is usually adysregulated CR (circadian rhythm).This is one of the reasons why despite the fact that tips about sleep can helpsome people sleep, it usually does not help them get deep restful sleep becausethey don’t address the circadian rhythm.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",206
Page 83,"So let’s see how to optimize it with the 12 steps i’ve shared with clients over theyears.I myself had chronic insomnia (could not sleep for more than 4 hours for years)and this is how I fixed it.I suggest you focus on truly optimizing your sleep for one week straight beforemoving to anything else.How to fix circadian rhythm dysregulation in 2-12 weeksStep 1:Wake up between 6 and 8 A.M if you can. Step 2:Do not look at any artificial light as soonas you wake up, have a glass offiltered water, a pinch of sea salt and either go for a walk around the block, or dosome breathing exercises from your balcony.If you can, sun gaze for a few seconds as well.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",173
Page 84,"Step 3:Eat something that includes animal protein,salt, fruit and some saturatedfats. You will see a lot of breakfast ideas soon.Eating breakfast is crucial. I can not tell you how many clients had severeinsomnia simply because they skipped breakfast and had black coffee instead.A combination popularized by the fitness industry which has led to thousands ofpeople suffering from adrenal fatigue.People today “fast” with poor quality espresso to the point of developing IBS, notto mention the rise of cortisol and adrenaline which further damages theirmetabolic health.Also short-term fasting reduces blood melatonin levels by even up to 30% insome cases so if you are experiencing insomnia or improper sleep, ask yourself ifyou are skipping breakfast.

Page 85,"Step 4:Do not check any electronic devices if youdon’t HAVE to (more aboutblue light in a second).Yes, blue light exposure in the morning is important for a regulated circadianrhythm, BUT, a combination of red light and blue light (the way natural lightexists) should be the first thing stimulating your photoreceptors and not manmade blue light.If you want to take this a step further, keep in mind that this is optional and notnecessary, exposing yourself first thing in the morning to red light from a red lightdevice will speed up the process of resetting your circadian rhythm even further.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",142
Page 86,"Step 5:Either eliminate or minimize your caffeineconsumption to 1 cup before 11A.M either consumed with a meal or with fats, some carbs and protein.Is caffeine that bad for sleep? Yes it is.If you are a regular coffee drinker you haven’t slept well in years.Caffeine binds to adenosine receptors (adenosine creates a pressure to sleep)making it impossible for your sleep cycles to be optimal.If your liver is fine you will be able to process caffeine just fine, but this does notmean that caffeine’s side effects are limited to sleep problems.Otherwise you wouldn’t be feeling intense withdrawals every time you cut it out.It is a fact that since most people today have never taken anything close to abreak from caffeine, that their health will be massively benefited from it and theirproductivity long term as well.Step 6:a) workout without burning yourself out andb) workout as early in the dayas you can (you will see workout splits soon).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",224
Page 87,"A common cause for sleep problems is over training which is surprisingly quitecommon to the people who are regular gym goers.You do not need to train for 5 hours. You are raising your cortisol and adrenalinelevels way too much in order not to face sleep problems.Step 7:Make time to expose your skin to the sun alittle after sunrise, for a briefperiod mid day and a few minutes before sunset with the additional grounding (donot neglect grounding during the day, it will massively improve your sleep,recovery and reduce the oxidative burden).Even 30 minutes in total can massively help you.Step 8:Block the blue light on your devices and wearblue light blocking glasses.

Page 90,"GABA is the true sleep promoter.GABA stands for gamma-aminobutyric acid and is the primary mediator of thehealthy inhibitory state of metabolism, most associated with sleep and relaxation.The most critical step in GABA optimization is fixing glutamate.Glutamate is a neurotransmitter that excites/stimulates nerve cells and plays abig role in learning and memory.Glutamate is the “gas” in your brain and GABA the “breaks”. If these two are notin proper balance, they can lead from things to hyperactivity and anxiety tolethargy (in case of glutamate being “too low”). Some people have “mega-pumped” glutamate in their system due to foodadditives in the last decades.This can be a long term problem since keeping glutamateand GABA balanced inthe brain is a big part of avoiding neurodegenerative conditions (too muchglutamate is associated with s diseases such as: Parkinson’s disease,Alzheimer’s disease and Huntington’s disease).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",235
Page 91,"In order to balance glutamate and GABA we must avoid foods and supplementsthat “signal” to the body to create glutamate.If you struggle not only with sleep problems but with issues such as anxiety aswell, it is best to avoid the following foods for a time period and see if you feelbetter (not all of these foods are bad exactly, your body simply might need abreak from them due to overconsumption of glutamate):- Caffeine.- Nicotine.- Stimulant drugs.- Protein powders.- Seasoning blends (you can make your own which will not be polluted with MSG)- Grains.- High fructose corn syrup.- Any type of sauce.- Canned food.- Corn and cornstarch.- Sweets (except fruit and raw honey).- Non home made chips/popcorn etc.- Egg and milk substitutes.- Artificial flavorings.- Potatoes.- Fermented foods (even pickles) and swiss cheese.- Broccoli, onion and garlic.- Parmesan cheese.- Mushrooms.- Soy products.- Low fat dairy.- Heavy whipping cream.- Food colorings.- Xanthan gum.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",237

Page 93,"Another thing to pay attention and try to minimize is blue light exposure sinceglutamate is triggered by blue light.When it comes to inositol, IP3 will help you balance GABA, not IP6.IP6 is a great antioxidant and tool for removing heavy metals but it won’t do muchfor GABA.Also L-Carnosine will upregulate GLT-1 (a glutamate transporter) but do not startwith too many supplements.Other sleep boosters with GABA promoting effects are:1)Passion flower2)Lemon balm3)Chamomile tea (safest)Obviously in order to optimize GABA we need to make sure that we have enoughnutrients that help synthesize GABA in the first place.These are: Thiamine, vitamin C, vitamin D (if you consider supplementing vitaminD make sure that it is a liquid form, combine it with a liquid form of K2 and alsomake sure you have enough vitamin A in your system), vitamin A, copper, zinc,magnesium, taurine and vitamin E.Preferred sources of these vitamins, aminos and minerals are: sunlight, berries,pomegranates, beef liver, oysters, lamb, magnesium glycinate and palm kerneloil.Thiamine is the most tricky one since most people are extremely deficient inthiamine and will require some form of supplementation.Thiamine is important since GABA promotes cellular regeneration through a risein CO2.A deficiency of GABA can also not be improved until sodium levels are restoredand a thiamine deficiency is probably the number 1 cause of such a deficiencysince to acquire the needed sodium and potassium regulators is pretty relativelyeasy.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",364
Page 94,"A magnesium deficiency will also lead to glutamate overactivity andsupplementing magnesium citrate (small dose) in the morning and magnesiumglycinate (regular dose) for a brief period of time (3-6 weeks) will help preventand fix this.When it comes to zinc, during GABA activity certain pathways in our body swapcopper for zinc, so without enough zinc this swap can not happen.For deeper discussions in nutrition and supplements you can check the specificlessons and chapters when the time comes.Last but not least, in order to optimize GABA, you need to get sunlight at least 3times a day.The reason why insomnia often occurs in wintertime or in people who spendplenty of time inside, is not due to melatonin, contrary to popular belief butbecause of GABA.If that’s the case for you, then provide enough antioxidants in your systemthrough foods like berries, cherries, acerola cherries, pomegranate juice with nopulp and vitamin A from beef liver (never combine these) and start spending asmuch time outside as you can.Then if you start getting extremely tired by 12-2P.M suboptimal GABA was yourinsomnia cause.Bonus : GABA tonic recipesGABA tonic #1 (as a pre workout in order to manage cortisol response)- Chamomile- Ginger- Raw honey- Coconut water- Salt- Taurine- L theanineⒸHelios_Movement LLC",307

Page 96,"●Low blood pressure●Lightheadedness●Loss of body hair●Skin discolorationAdrenal fatigue can be diagnosed by blood tests that show inadequate levels ofadrenal hormones.Proponents of the adrenal fatigue diagnosis claim this is a mild form of adrenalAdrenal fatigue simply means that your adrenal glands are unable to keep upwith the demands of the fight-or-flight arousal.The adrenal glands secrete cortisol which greatly regulates sleep and thusadrenal fatigue is can be a cause of sleep problems.Bullet points to improve adrenal fatigueNumber 1:Stop fasting.Get 3 meals a day in and 1-2 possible snacks coming from quality food sourcesthat are demonstrated during this program (obviously, the meal plan that youreceived, has this covered)Number 2:If your diet has been low in vitamin C,up the dietary vitamin Cthrough sources such as camu camu and acerola cherry since under the state ofadrenal fatigue, the adrenal glands dumb vitamin C at a very high rate andvitamin C is something very crucial for the health of our endocrine system (thisdepletion of vitamin C is one of the reasons why people get sick when stressed(obviously there are many more reasons why this happens)).Number 3:Make sure that you have addressed oxidativestress as you read onmodule 1.2.Number 4:Address the health of mast cells.A mast cell is a type of white blood cell and is found in connective tissuesthroughout your body.Mast cells help your immune system function properly and normally help protectus from disease.Mast cells synthesize and secrete histamine, proteases,prostaglandin D2,leukotrienes, heparin and a variety of cytokines which all contribute to the releaseof stress hormones to various degrees.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",401
Page 97,"We will address this by firstadding foods that stabilize mast cells (howantihistamine drugs work).These include:●Chamomile●Turmeric●Ginger●Apples (skin off in order to avoid the pesticides and herbicides)●Peaches (skin off)And then adding natural mast cell inhibitors which are :1) QuercetinQuercetin inhibits the mast cells and stabilizes cortisol.Quercetin is fat soluble so you’ll need to consume it with a fatty meal in order toincrease the absorption.Quercetin has a half life of 2 hours, so after the first 2 days that you’ll take it oncein order to see if you have some negative reaction to it, you’re going to up it to 3times a day.2) OystersLow levels of zinc can lead to a histamine intolerance since the zinc chelatorN,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) inhibits the release ofhistamine, the production of cytokines, and the secretion of lipid mediators inmast cells.Also a zinc deficiency greatly promotes an adrenaline excess so oysters will helpyou with this as well.3) Black cumin seed oilBlack cumin seed oil has great antihistamine effects and is one of the moststudied natural remedies that has been utilized for its medicinal properties forover two thousand years.Blackseed oil is superior to all other natural anti microbiotics for one more reason.When things such as oregano oil wipe out all pathogenic microorganisms (thisincludes the good strains of bacteria as well), black cumin seed oil attacks thepathogenic and spoilage bacteria but not good strains such as lactobacillus.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",386

Themost common type is called obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).Unconsciously holding your breath during sleep, is a sign of low metabolic ratesince your body attempts to preserve spare CO2 and oxygen by holding yourbreath.Step 0:If you smoke, quit smoking.Without this we can’t improve the condition.If you have trouble quitting smoking : a) stabilize your blood sugar levels as youwill see on how to optimize glucose metabolism part of this lesson and b)get oncreatine for a few weeks in order to not feel so intense withdrawals and useginkgo biloba (other strategies on how to optimize dopamine that aredemonstrated on how to optimize your mood part of the program can be helpfulas well).Step 1:Breathe through your nose and rest your tongueat the top of your pallet.It is estimated that about 30 to 50 percent of adults breathe through their mouths.If you breathe through your mouth you’re damaging your health and changing theway your face looks. When nasal breathing is blocked, mouth breathing leads tothe development of long, narrow faces with crooked teeth, receded jaw, cancause TMD (temporomandibular joint dysfunction), gum disease, brain fog andheadaches.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",422
Page 99,"One more reason why breathing through your nose is important, is because whenyou breathe through the nose, you are forcing air through structures that heat,humidify, filter (which plays a big role for our immune system) and pressure theair so when it gets to your lungs in can be more easily “uploaded” to yourbloodstream.This is why we can extract about 20 per cent more oxygen breathing through ournoses than we can breathing through our mouths.A lot of people are mouth breathers due to allergies. If this is the case, besidescleaning up your diet and removing potential allergens (pesticides,xenoestrogens etc), checking your vitamin D levels, addressing unbound iron asdemonstrated on the heavy metal detox part and adding local bee pollen andlocal raw honey into your diet will work great as well.So when you catch yourself breathing through your mouth, consciously shift yourattention back into breathing from your nose.Step 2:Stop eating a high inflammatory diet madeof mucus promoting foods andstick to a low histamine diet as the one prescribed in the gut healing part.Step 3:Battle sleep apnea’s reactive oxygen specieswith antioxidants such asvitamin C and E coming from whole foods prior to going to sleep.Step 4:Stop using fragrances and unnatural cosmeticproducts since reactiveoxygen species are generated as a response to xenobiotics as well.For every toxic fragrance and cosmetic product there is a natural alternativewhich is also more effective as you will see on the xenoestrogen detox part.Oxidative stress refers to the imbalance due to excess ROS or oxidants over thecapability of the cell to mount an effective antioxidant responseStep 5:Optimize CO2 throughsunlight, quality carbohydratessuch as seasonalfruit and raw honey, optimize your thyroid as you will see in the thyroid part anduse some of the following techniques as well.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",407

Page 102,"The problem with phytic acid when it comes to sleep (since phytic acid leads tomany problems), is that it prevents calcium from being absorbed andcalcium helps the brain to manufacture the sleep-inducing substance melatonin.So, do not over consume vegetables and when you do: a) slow cook them inanimal fats in order to lower the anti nutrient content and peel the skin off inthings such as potatoes and carrots since the skin is the part of the plan with themost antinutrients.This is why raw greens taste less pleasant than cooked ones. Our tongue sensesthe presence of phytic acid and signals to us that this green thing is somethingthat we should avoid (at least in that particular form).When it comes to nuts and seeds: a)do not over consume them and b)alwayssprout them in order to again lower the antinutrient content.SolanineSolanine is commonly found in nightshades such as the potatoes, tomatoes,eggplants and peppers.Solanine over-stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system (it can even causeneurological damage in large amounts) and can cause issues such as anxietyand insomnia.Failure to remove phytic acid from the diet means that it binds all calcium,magnesium, and other important nutrients in the digestive tract and thus entirelyprevents their absorption.Number 2: Serotonin excess.Most myths around serotonin have been busted so far and people realize nowthat’s actually a stress hormone and if you want to be high on one thing thatthing is dopamine and not serotonin.A serotonin excess produces many problems such as: IBS, cancer, neurologicaldamage, anxiety, mood disorders, hair loss, hypothyroidism, headaches,migraines, low testosterone, fertility problems and it impairs our learning ability.A serotonin excess will lead to dopamine and GABA imbalances and thus sleepproblems (especially with REM sleep).General symptoms that are linked with serotonin excess are the following.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",428

Second of all, if you want to usesupplements, DHEA and pregnenolone can help given that you have enoughvitamin A (retinol) in your system, but make sure to read the entire course first, inorder to gain a better understanding on how to use supplements.A “safer” so to speak supplement that a lot of people will also benefit from, will beniacinamide which has great antiestrogenic properties in general and which wewill discuss in depth later in this lesson.Cocoa butter and boron can help you optimize DHT under this context as well.The anti aromatase effects of fat soluble vitamins will also help boost DHT (someof them indirectly).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",415

You will learn more about B vitamins and how to properly use them inthe entire course.Balance tryptophan with the other amino acids.Add glycine once a day, a side of bone marrow once a day and some grass fedgelatin can also be an option once in a while in case that you can not find qualitybone marrow.Lower stress since stress stimulates serotonin production.When and only when you are sleep deprived and very tiredit is useful tosupplement creatine in order to lower the excess serotonin.Deep sleep, calcium and vitamin DIn order to optimize sleep, we need to optimize our metabolism in any other waywe can.Sleep is actually a high metabolic state despite what most people think so if aperson’s metabolism is suboptimal to begin with, he will of course face troublessleeping.There are many ways to optimize one’s metabolism and all of them are equallyimportant in the long run, but there are 2 main things that directly affect sleep.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",378
Page 106,"Calcium:Phosphorus ratio and vitamin D levels.Without enough (bioavailable) calcium, phosphorus’ energetic potential can notbe contained and used, so it will lead to cellular damage and suboptimalmetabolic rate.So one big reason for suboptimal metabolic health and thus poor sleep is theimproper Calcium:Phosphorus ratio.Note: without the proper calcium regulators such as magnesium, vitamin D andK2 (which are both great anti-calcification factors and can thus be used toimprove pineal function, bone health and improve prostate problems as well)calcium begins to saturate cells more than it should as well and cause insomnia(magnesium for example directs excessive calcium outside the cell).So first, you should implement everything we have discussed so far and notmake too many changes at once because you will not be able to pinpoint at whatwas most effective.Then if you are still suffering from insomnia, having a sufficient intake of bothcalcium and magnesium , especially before bed will be crucial.But eliminating all grains, legumes, seeds, nuts and most uncooked vegetablesfor 4 weeks at this point will be crucial as well since oxalic and phytic acid block,displace or bind calcium and prevent it from being absorbed and utilized from thebody.A side of bone broth between meals and the elimination of phosphoric beveragessuch as coca cola (any type) for another 4 weeks will also be crucial.I recommend sticking to the thyroid supportive plan that is presented in thislesson in order to prevent the parathyroid from facilitating the leaching of calciumfrom bones and even soft tissue calcification.Note: Calcium will obviously not lead to kidney stones as doctors sometimes saysince kidney stones indicate a magnesium and vitamin D deficiency as well as anexcess of parathyroid hormone.When it comes to calcium sources, eggshell powder can be a great source ofbioavailable calcium but a lot of people face low stomach acid problems and it isbest to be avoided at the moment.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",431
Page 107,"We address gut health in detail later, but for now keep in mind the the three mosteffective sources for calcium besides eggshells powder will be organic goatcheese, organic unflavoured casein protein and, unfortunately this is very schizo,add a splash of vinegar, 250-500 μg of artificial b12 and some raw honey toorganic milk.I know how this sounds, but this is the only way to precipitate the calcium andphosphorus and also make the calcium more bioavailable.Now, vitamin D obviously has many key roles in one’s metabolism but sleep wise,vitamin D is required to make calcium bioavailable and optimize thecalcium:phosphorus ratio.Sunlight is obviously the preferred source of vitamin D, but this can be inhibitedby some things we will mention in a few pages and one should focus on exposinghimself to the sunlight the right way.What i want to mention about vitamin D at this stage of the course is that vitaminD requires butyric acid from indigestible carbohydrates such as pectins in order tobe absorbed and utilized properly.This is one of the reasons why i have seen carnivores who literally spent 8 hoursoutside in the sun every day with 15ng/dL.So the people who still suffer from insomnia after implementing everything thatwe have said and even after getting plenty of sunlight on a constant basis, shouldtry consuming some pectins with breakfast and a liquid vitamin D3+K2 formulawith lunch for 1-4 weeks.If this is the root problem of their insomnia (vitamin D) the effects should becomenoticeable from day 3 up to 2 weeks.The last thing that i will mention is that people experience insomnia because theyhave never taken a deload week or week off the gym in their entire lives andshould take a break since their CNS is more fried than they might think.Combating sleep problems in the winter.The winter creates sleep problems for a lot of people mostly due to the rise ofstress hormones and reduction in progesterone.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",433
Page 108,"Darkness is identified as a stress as it impairs energy production and causeschronic rises in adrenaline as well.The body cannot differentiate darkness between a dark room or night timeresulting in the release of stress chemicals.I actually tell clients to dial in their diets in the winter way more than in thesummer.This means that if you are experiencing sleep problems when winter time arrivesand you have not cleaned up your diet already it’s time for you to slowly improveit.The winter inevitably comes with an absence of light and this has multiplecatabolic effects in our biology especially for the ones that have been avoidingthe sunlight during the summer for years.So the first step is getting a cheap red light device or even lamp which you willuse to expose yourself to red light once after you wake up and once at sunset.Red light helps cells produce energy and synthesize protective steroid hormonessuch as progesterone. Red light will also reduce stress hormones that are beingreleased as a result of darkness.Something as simple as getting red light on your skin, can have such a profoundeffect upon your metabolism, estrogen dominance, energy, mood and fatsynthesis.Which brings us to the fact that we need to address a very possible estrogendominance.More details about this will be given in lesson 2 but here’s what you need to knowfor now.What estrogens have to do with sleep problems during the winter?Both progesterone and cortisol are released from our adrenal glands.During the winter the absence of light can not only create a progesteronedeficiency to begin with but also increase cortisol and adrenaline that will lead toan estrogen dominant state.Any stressful state will directly reduce the production of progesterone and lessprogesterone = more estrogen.Before considering any possible progesterone supplementation, you should trythe following for 2-3 weeks.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",395
Page 109,"First of all if you are a man with over 20% body fat and a woman with over 25%body fat, read the guide on how to effortlessly get lean which will help you losesome weight in a pro metabolic way.Fat tissue is a part of our hormonal system and our fat tissue containsaromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen.So after a certain body fat percentage, the more fat you have the more estrogenyou will have.Now the more estrogen you have the less active thyroid hormone you will havewhich will also result in sleep problems.That was step 1.Step 2 is addressing xenoestrogens (which include birth control pills) ( i hadclients with intense sleep problems simply because they were trying to sleep inclothes made out of polyester) and PUFAs as you will read on the PUFA andxenoestrogen detox guides.Step 3 is having the binder salad 4 times a week which will help you reduceexcess estrogen since the fibers of the carrot will attach to any unusedendotoxins and help flush them out of the body.Step 4 is getting rid of alcohol and phytoestrogens which can also inhibit theconversion of T4 to T3 and slow metabolism.Step 5 is to not over do it with cardio which can reduce thyroid hormone andincrease estrogen.Step 6 is to check your vitamin D status since vitamin D is necessary for theconversion of hormones.Step 7 is to reduce stress if possible (re-read GABA optimization for this) whichwill allow your adrenal glands to produce more progesterone.Step 8 if this was not obvious, still spend as much time under natural light aspossible during the day in order to boost the synthesis of sex hormones andreduce excess estrogen.Step 9 is to increase the calcium during the winter from sources such as eggshellpowder after optimizing gut health in order to reduce parathyroid stress hormone.Step 10 is to make sure to consume enough saturated fats since adequatesaturated fat helps men to produce more testosterone and women moreprogesterone.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",434
Page 110,"Optional step 11 is to consider either gelatin or supplementing glycine sinceglycine has an inhibitory effect on estrogen’s action and can help offset excessestrogen.Optional step 12 after making sure that you have been following the dietprinciples on this course would be to supplement a small dose of pregnenoloneevery other day or even twice a week.But just as beta carotene puts the body’s needs of retinol on overdrive, so doespregnenolone.Pregnenolone is what is called the “mother hormone” and is the raw material forproducing many of the steroid and protective hormones such as DHEA andprogesterone.Since pre-cursors are more effective than the actual thing most of the time, yourfirst step (in case that you are not a woman over 30) should be tryingpregnenolone and not progesterone for sleep problems during the winter.If you are a woman over 30 with symptoms of estrogen dominance(*), you haveexperienced lots of stress the last period or even years and suffer fromsuboptimal metabolic health, you can try short term progesteronesupplementation which is something thatshould bealways cycled.If you are a man over 30 with intense sleep problems, symptoms of estrogendominance and adrenal fatigue, you can try short term DHEA supplementation.Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone that our bodies naturally producemainly in the adrenal gland and helps in the production of other hormones suchas testosterone and progesterone.Obviously, all of these supplements are short term tools to get the ball rollingfaster, you don’t have to rely on supplements to get decent sleep after a certainpoint.Estrogen dominance is actually a lack of progesterone – or when the actions ofestrogen are greater than that of progesterone .(*)Symptoms of estrogen dominance include:●Fat storage (hips, butts and thighs in women and belly fat in men)●Irritability/Outbursts●Water retention●Bloating●Gynecomastia●Fertility problems●PMSⒸHelios_Movement LLC",468

Page 113,"⅔ of our ATP levels are dependent on our light environment.Light of different wave-lengths has the potential to interact with four majormitochondrial protein complexes that are involved in the generation of ATP.Neurones of the central nervous system have an absolute dependence onmitochondrial generated ATP.Laboratory studies show that short-wave or blue light (400–480 nm) thatimpinges on the retina affect flavin and cytochrome constituents associated withmitochondria to decrease the rate of ATP formation, stimulate ROS and result incell death.This suggests that blue light could potentially have a negative influence on retinalganglion cell (RGC) mitochondria that are abundant and not shielded by macularpigments as occurs for photoreceptor mitochondria.Long-wave or red light (650–800 nm) affects mitochondrial complex IV orcytochrome oxidase to increase the rate of formation of ATP and ROS causingthe generation of a number of beneficial factors.Significantly, laboratory studies show that increasing the normal amount ofnatural red light reaching rat RGC mitochondria in situ, subjected to ischemia,proved to be beneficial.The first step for optimizing our light environment is addressing blue light (whichis also crucial for GABA optimization but i wanted to mention it here in moredetail).One of the big reasons that we are sick, depressed, anxious, diabetic, have wildfood cravings and our eyesight is getting pretty bad, is artificial blue light.Our mitochondria and light are extremely connected as we said so our lightenvironment greatly determines our mitochondrial health and as a result ourhealth in general.Blue light exists in nature and has many benefits for our well being. But thedownsides of blue light in nature are balanced by the red light that also exists innature (this is the reason why a lot of blue light blocking glasses can be red-ish).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",399
Page 114,"This obviously is not the case for artificial blue light.You have all the downside without the upside. You have all the stimulation that’scausing you insomnia, heart problems, diabetes, ages you, messes up yourdopamine and serotonin without any upside.Artificial blue light is not “bad” in an absolute way exactly. It has helped us savemillions of lives (in the ER for example) but we have stopped treating it as a tooland that's harming us. You won’t die if you expose yourself to artificial blue lighton a random night. But are you exposing yourself to it once in a blue moon or areyou bombarded with it through smart phones, TVs, tablets, poorly manufacturedlight bulbs and computer screens from the moment you wake up to the momentyou go to bed?This will obviously cause a lot of damage long term.So the question is, are you using it as a tool or you don’t even recognise that it isa tool which you shouldn’t be using if you don’t need it?Our light environment determines our health way more than we probably realize.Take professional video gamers for example. Some people think that they live offjunk food and energy drinks, this is true in a lot of cases but in the last few yearsa lot of them have been eating super clean, working out like maniacs and livingvery healthy lifestyles but they are still sick and depressed. Why? Well, they livein an unnatural environment which leads to unnatural reactions.Our light environment affects everything because our mitochondria affecteverything.You wanna know also why the memes about guys who spent all day in front of acomputer portray them filled with acne? It’s because one of the causes of acnecan be insulin resistance and blue light can directly cause this. Videogamers veryrarely stop being in front of a computer at night time.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",405
Page 115,"The problem with this is that just one night of moderate blue light exposureincreases next-morning insulin resistance. Just one night. Blue light messes upwith your insulin response without you consuming a single calorie.You’ve probably experienced this yourself the times you have spent hours atnight in an environment filled with blue light (on a night out, a festival etc). At theend of the night you probably had some wild cravings and this is not acoincidence since blood sugar drops can lead to cravings and as we said bluelight at night messes up with your insulin responses.It’s no wonder also why the people who work night shifts are depressed, fat,diabetic, irritable and have heart problems. They spent years of their lives underthe most toxic light known to man. As a joke once, i wore the blue light blockers afriend had at a festival once and had zero, ZERO, food cravings by the end of itdespite the fact that i had 3 or 4 drinks and alcohol messes up your blood sugarvery badly (the main reason you crave junk when you drink besides dopamine).So is artificial blue light at night messing us up even more than alcohol? Couldvery well be. After all, it has shown to affect pretty bad cancer cells in a lot ofstudies.The reason for this probably is that artificial blue light exposure at night stops thesecretion of melatonin.Melatonin is one of the very few things that actually keeps us healthy andprevents disease by repairing mitochondria.When you mess up with melatonin, well, you stop preventing disease andbasically invite cancer or another form of metabolic disease. Also melatoninbesidesbeing a free radical scavenger reduces nitricoxide generation withinmitochondria.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",375
Page 116,"It maintains the electron flow, efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, ATPproduction and bioenergetic function of the cell.Artificial blue light makes everyone slightly depressed nowadays since it lacksred light (among others) resulting in (this is a medical wrong term) dopaminedysregulation.In case you’re suffering from depression you should spend as little time underartificial light as you can. Sunlight has a clinical effect on people suffering fromdepression.Hospital patients with depression who stay in brighter rooms are on averageadmitted for30 days fewerthan patients who stayedin darker rooms.Many studies have shown that sunlight can decrease depression scores andeven increase cognitive performance.After all, yellow is characterized as the happiest color and has been used fordecades in light therapy to improve the mood of people who suffer with mooddisorders.Blue light toxicity can even cause panic attacks since glutamate is theneurotransmitter of the neurons of the vertical pathways through the retina and allphotoreceptor types, rods and cones use glutamate to transmit signals to the nextorder neuron in the chain. (More about glutamate and what it is in a few pages).Blue light also severely damages our eyesight and retinas.There is evidence that artificial blue light can thin our retina and damage oureyes in general. One more problem this produces is that when you mess up yourphotoreceptors, you mess up your body’s ability to use light and regulate a lot ofimportant functions such as your digestion, glucose metabolism and yourcircadian rhythm.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",326
Page 117,"So, here’s the main lesson.If you want to optimal mitochondrial health, you should expose yourself to as littleartificial blue light as you can at night, while you also: a) start wearing blue lightblocking glasses and block the blue light on your phone, tablet and computer byusing blue light blocking programs, b) spend as much time in outside as you canand c) try not to each too much after the sun is down (under blue light).Moving on now to sunlight.Sun gives life to everything on this earth. Without the sun , everything will die.Every animal , human and plant needs sun in order to function and grow properly.If sunlight causes cancer, we would have gone extinct many years ago.We need the sun for so many biochemical processes it is hard to mention even1/1.000.000 of them.Without the sun , your health will deteriorate pretty fat in multiple areas.Your testosterone, your insulin sensitivity, your muscles, your CNS, your eyes,your skin, your mood, your focus, your energy. Every single one of these thingswill take a hit and no amount of vitamins and medication can undo the damagesfrom lack of sun exposure.Sunlight is way more effective than a lot of steroids (it can even double yourtestosterone levels and significantly lowers insulin resistance), antidepressantsand medication for common diseases in general. Early sunlight exposure caneven reverse some of the symptoms of the damage blue light has done to theskin and eyes (obviously do not look directly at the sun).Sunlight exposure is also crucial for our T cell function and without this we prettymuch have no defense against foreign pathogens.

Page 118,"10 rules for safe sun exposureNumber 1: Since our skin is made out of the things that we eat, do not consumeany of the following : inferior fats such as canola oil, soybean oil, corn oil and ingeneral oils that are easily oxidized (see the PUFA awareness and detoxprotocol), margarine, sugar, unsprouted grains, soy, legumes, artificialsweeteners, soy, alcohol, coffee (you can apply coffee on your skin though and itcan protect it from oxidative damage) and nicotine (using nicotine under the sun,will increase free radicals too much and lead to skin aging).Your diet should include the following foods : free range eggs, quality dairy, redmeat, saturated fats, bone marrow, fruits high in vitamin C (do not combine foodshigh in iron high in vitamin C) , seafood such as oysters (for copper and zinc),organ meats and some cacao.Note: An ideal breakfast would be eggs cooked in coconut oil and seasonal fruit.If your iron levels are not low, adding turmeric with black pepper on your eggs afew times per week (daily use can lower DHT long term) is a very efficientdopamine booster that will also activate vitamin D receptors.Number 2: Gradually expose yourself to the sun. Start only by sunbathing for5-15 minutes at sunrise and sunset. You should never burn, your skin shouldnever become red when you sunbathe.Number 3: Moisturize with aloe vera. This is actually super important and sinceyour skin is an organ, by hydrating from outside in, you can reduce some of thestress hormones sunbathing can produce and it will also lead to a better tan.Number 4: Up the vitamin C. The days you sunbathe, you are going to needanywhere from 300mg all the way to even 1.000mg of vitamin C per daydepending on how much time you spend under the sun. You can get even up to500mg of vitamin C from your diet, but it might be a good idea to use asupplement form of vitamin C that is coming from whole foods (acerola cherryⒸHelios_Movement LLC",460
Page 119,"powder, camu camu powder and things of this nature) in moderation as well priorto sun exposure.Number 5: 100-200mg of magnesium in the morning since the sun can a)depleteyou of magnesium and b) magnesium leads to a better tan.But, do not supplement magnesium in the middle of the day since it can affect theabsorption of vitamin D levels.Number 6: Start consuming beta carotene 4-7 times a week preferably frompumpkin, squash and carrots.Number 7: Do not neglect the fat soluble vitamins and saturated fats.Both of them protect and moisturize your skin.Number 8: Do not shower with hot water and end up dehydrating your skin.Number 9: If you have to spend a lot of time in the sun you should apply mineralbased sunscreen.Number 10: Ideally you want to sunbathe barefoot/grounded in order to reduceROS.Number 11: Do not wear glasses, contacts or sunglasses when out in the sununless you have to since you will mess up the photoreceptors that signal yourbody to produce both melanin and melatonin.Note:If sunlight hits your skin through any typeof glass for a lot of hours that’snot good and you should use mineral based sunscreen.Before we continue, a note on glycogen.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",287
Page 120,"Glycogen is the stored form of glucose that’s made up of many connectedglucose molecules.Glucose is our main source of energy and comes fromcarbohydrates.When our bodies don’t immediately need glucose from the food you eat forenergy, it stores glucose primarily in our liver(*), muscles(**), kidneys andintestines.This stored glycogen then is used as an immediate energy source (the body’spreferred fuel) and provides energy to the brain and red blood cells.Our bodies create glycogen from glucose through a process called glycogenesis(the body breaks down glycogen for use through a process calledglycogenolysis).Glycogen and glucose are related to how your body uses its main source ofenergy from carbohydrates, but they have different functions.We get glucose from carbohydrates in the food we eat and it’s the primary sourceof energy for our brains which have a constant requirement for glucose.Now glycogen comes from your body digesting these carbohydrates and turningthem into glucose so it can use it for fuel.So, glycogen is the stored form of glucose.(*)Our bodies mainly use the stored glycogen in our liver to help regulate bloodglucose (sugar) levels with the hormones glucagon and insulin.The glycogen stores in the liver also help with exercise.At the start of exercise, your liver begins breaking down glycogen to maintainblood glucose levels as your working muscles use it for energy.However, your muscles primarily use their own glycogen stores to function.(**)Muscle glycogen serves mainly as a source of metabolic fuel for your musclesand if your muscles relied on glucose from your bloodstream for this energy, yourbody would quickly run out of glucose so the body stores 3/4 of your totalglycogen in all of your skeletal muscles.Module 1.5: How to optimize glucose metabolism. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",403
Page 121,"We started by mentioning the pro-metabolic and anti-metabolic compounds,sleep and sunlight, since properly addressing these you can not optimize glucosemetabolism. It is literally impossible.For example, PUFAs are a bigger cause for diabetes than sugar and we’reobviously not crazy at all for stating that.It’s not rocket science if you understand that the consumption of inferior fatsdestroys our ability to metabolize carbs in general.It goes back to the fact that they cause oxidative destruction of mitochondriawhich oxidize carbohydrates for energy.PUFAs remodel the cardiolipin(*) structure of mitochondria causing cellular deathand leakage of potassium they destroy our metabolism.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",159
Page 122,"(*)Cardiolipin is a phospholipid, which is exclusively located in mitochondria andplays an important role in regulating various kinds of mitochondrial proteins suchas electron transport complexes, carrier proteins and phosphate kinases, and isalso essential for the organization of particular mitochondrial structures such ascristae and contact sites.PUFA metabolites (leukotrienes) are so damaging for our health that they caneven trigger Type 1 diabetes whichis an autoimmunecondition (the beta-cells ofthe pancreas get attacked by the immune system and over time this leads to theirdestruction and inability to produce insulin).We have dedicated an entire chapter to PUFAs in this lesson but for now youmust keep in mind that you should avoid sunflower oil, almond oil, canola oil,soybean oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, flaxseed oil, fish oil, rapeseed oil and ingeneral oils that did not exist 2000 years ago like the plague if you want tooptimize glucose metabolism and metabolic health as a result of that.Cutting out these specific PUFAs is a crucial step to restoring proper sugar (sugaris a broad term, it does not mean literally sugar) oxidation since the presence ofPUFAs inhibits the kynurenine pathway.The kynurenine pathway is a metabolic pathway leading to the production ofnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+).Prolonged disequilibrium of NAD+ metabolism results in every metabolic diseasepossible.NAD’s function in the body is to shuttle electrons from processes which obtainenergy from food to those which then use that energy.In simple terms, this pathway promotes the proper metabolism of carbohydratesand the most important vitamin for this pathway is the NAD precursorⒸHelios_Movement LLC",379

Page 124,"As you can see, these two are crucial for the citric acid cycle that we mentionedprior in this program and a deficiency in these 2 (which is not uncommon) isenough to cause severe metabolic problems.Carbs have been demonized for way too long and a low carb diet does nothingfor addressing the above serious deficiencies most of the time.Carbs are not the problem, suboptimal ability to metabolize carbs is the problem.Carb intolerance is a sign that our ability to oxidize carbohydrates needsimprovement, and not that carbohydrates are bad, which will only end upexacerbating the problem since carbohydrate deficiency decreases the body’sability to respond to stress and thus increases the severity of the effects of suchstress upon organs and metabolic pathways.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",168
Page 125,"So it is the ability to metabolize carbs, not carbs themselves which is responsiblefor carb related health problems.If you ever went zero carb, you know the horrific withdrawals that carb restrictioncan lead to. Why is that? Well our body can not run efficiently withoutcarbohydrates.Many people when they go zero carb find themselves experiencing panic attacksand even being unable to breathe for example as a result of chronic low carbdieting.This. Is. Not. Normal. And there’s no reason to be in ketosis for more than 4weeks per year for 99.9999% of people and this even might be too much forsome people.Of course, ketosis can be a great short term tool, but short term, not long term.Now the number 1 sign of suboptimal glucose metabolism is constant sugarcravings (this signs an inappropriate metabolism of carbs once they aredigested).If one’s glucose metabolism is healthy, carb cravings do not occur often duringthe day since carbs are directed first toward storage as glycogen (which isdesigned to constantly release small amounts of glucose into the bloodstreambetween meals to sustain blood glucose levels) and then the production ofenergy.B vitamins are involved in the enzymatic processes which run cellular respiration,and a deficiency of the important ones can interrupt the process.

Lack of cholesterol, lack of zinc, lack of B12, lack ofelectrolytes/minerals and lack of antioxidants.So by following the diet that this course promotes, should address these 5 factorsas well.Depending on where you live, 30-120 minutes of sunlight exposure are enough inorder to get enough vitamin D.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",206

The thyroid is one of the glands that make up the endocrine system.The glands of the endocrine system produce and store hormones and releasethem into the bloodstream.The hormones then travel through the body and direct the activity of the body’scells.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",166
Page 132,"Thyroid hormone is what regulates metabolism and without enough thyroidhormone, most of the body’s functions slow down.The thyroid gland makes two thyroid hormones:-Triiodothyronine (T3)and-Thyroxine (T4)T3 is made from T4 and is the more active hormone, directly affecting the tissues.When (inactive) T4 is released into the bloodstream, it goes to the liver and otherorgans to be converted into (active) T3.This conversion is known as deiodination of T4 and is a process which happensprimarily within the liver and organs such as the kidneys and small intestines.This is the primary action of the thyroid and the second one is to regulatecirculating calcium levels (by using calcitonin which regulates too much calcium)along with the parathyroid and its PTH (parathyroid hormone which regulates toolittle calcium).The thyroid gland directly communicates with the brain, the pituitary, theparathyroid, the pancreas, the liver, the adrenal glands and the intestinal system.Thyroid hormone production is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),which is made by the pituitary gland in the brain.When thyroid hormone levels in the blood are low, the pituitary releases moreTSH (which raises LDL).When thyroid hormone levels are high, the pituitary responds by dropping TSHproduction.Hypothyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland does not makeenough thyroid hormone to meet the body’s needs.There are 10 typical signs of suboptimal thyroid function and hencesuboptimal metabolic function.These are:Sign #1: Chronic fatigueⒸHelios_Movement LLC",367
Page 133,"Sign #2: Not being hungry in the morningSign #3: Low body temperature and slowed heart rateSign #4: Thinning hair ( which is very different than hair loss)Sign #5: Dry skinSign #6: High LDLSign #7: InsomniaSign #8: Low libidoSign #9: Inability to put on muscle massSign #10: High prolactinIf you are experiencing 3 or more of these, chances are that you have suboptimalmetabolic function (don’t worry this is pretty common and reversible).A typical thyroid panel test would include:1)TSH (1.0 – 2.5 μIU/mL)2)Total T4 ( 6.0 – 11.9 mcg/dL)3)Total T3 (100 – 168 ng/dL)4)Reverse T3 (14.9 – 24.1 ng/dL)5)Free T4 (1.0 – 1.5 ng/dL)6)Free T3 (3.0 – 4.0 pg/mL)ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",238
Page 134,"7)Thyroid antibodies (0 – 15 IU/mL)Now in most cases hypothyroidism can be completely controlled with the rightlifestyle changes and perhaps liothyronine (cytomel and triostat).I don’t recommend you start supplementing T3 since i find it ridiculous.These products are heavily overdosed and very few people actually need it.Also synthetic thyroxine which is what is prescribed in most cases (T4 instead ofT3) tends to harm the liver even more.(I am not against it though if combined properly with T3 for the rare cases thatneed T3)A client's severe hypothyroidism got solved in 5 weeks.We're talking about a 345 anti-TPO, a 42.55 anti-tg and a 5.09 TSH.Everything got down to normal in 5 weeks.So reversing bad thyroid and metabolic function is do-able if a personunderstands the fundamentals of good metabolic health.

Page 137,"Of course you haven’t.You start by throwing in slim and small pieces of wood until you create a fire thatcan burn bigger ones and again bigger ones up to a point.Again, the same thing applies for our metabolism.So this is the simple metaphor that we will use in order to understand how ourmetabolism works.Now, most people, as we said, do not have an actual thyroid problem but aconversion problem.The active thyroid hormones are converted in small amounts on organs such asthe small intestines and the kidneys and in large amounts on the liver (70-80%).So, the conversion problem is what needs to be addressed first in order tooptimize thyroid performance.Which are the most common things that cause conversion problems andhow can we address them?Number 1: Not enough thyroid supportive nutrients in the dietThese are:1)Copperwhich is required for the synthesis of thyroidhormones.Best sources of copper are beef liver and oysters.2)Seleniumwhich is also required for the synthesisof thyroid hormones and aselenium deficiency usually leads to autoimmune thyroiditis.Best sources of selenium are: seafood, beef, chicken, turkey and brazil nuts (donot eat more than 3-5 per day).Note: some people don’t pay attention to vitamin Cwhen it comes to thyroid butvitamin C affects the entire endocrine system and also a deficiency affectsselenium metabolism which will directly affect thyroid.3)Zincwhich is required for the synthesis of thyroidhormones but also thefunction of T3 receptors.Zinc is one of the primary facilitators of proper thyroid function because zinc it a)is responsible for vitamin A activity b)the synthesis of thyroid hormone and c) it isinvolved in the pathways responsible for the recycling of vitamin C.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",385
Page 138,"Best sources of zinc are: oysters and beef.Which brings us to4) Vitamin CVitamin C is the first defender when it comes to the protection of many vitalorgans (especially the heart) including the thyroid.Best sources of vitamin C are berries, camu camu, acerola cherry (personalfavorite), pomegranates, grapefruit juice (no pulp) and orange juice (no pulp).5)Vitamin A + B12which are required both for theproper utilization of thyroidhormones.Vitamin A regulates thyroid hormone metabolism and inhibits thyroid-stimulatinghormone (TSH).The best source for these 2 is beef liver.6)Iodinewhich is required for the synthesis of thyroidhormones.The thyroid hormone itself is an iodine containing protein.We recycle a TON of iodine every day and you should NOT supplement iodine.The best sources for iodine are some seaweed every once in a while, cod andshrimp.7)Vitamin DA deficiency of vitamin D will downregulate thyroid function.Optimal thyroid health can not be expected without enough vitamin D aka sunexposure.A minimum of one hour of direct sunlight exposure to skin each day aftersomeone has built up to it, is necessary for the full functioning of thehypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis and stimulate the parts of the brain whichwould otherwise downregulate the metabolic rate.Sunlight is obviously the best source of vitamin D (if you have enough zinc andvitamin C in your system) but if you want to supplement vitamin D do not exceed4.000IUs per day and a) use a liquid form b)also use a liquid form of K2 and c)make sure you have enough vitamin A in your system as we said.8)Beta caroteneWithout pro-vitamin A, aka carotene the body cannot make or use thyroidhormone.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",411
Page 139,"Supplementing beta carotene is extremely dangerous and one should includefoods such as pumpkin, squash, sweet potatoes, peaches and apricots on hisdiet.9)CalciumIn order to perform some vital daily functions, the body works to keep a steadyamount of calcium in the blood and tissues.If calcium levels drop too low in the blood, parathyroid hormone (PTH) will signalthe bones to release calcium into the bloodstream.At the same time, PTH signals the kidneys to release less calcium in the urine.When the body has enough calcium, a different hormone called calcitonin worksto do the opposite: it lowers calcium levels in the blood by stopping the release ofcalcium from bones and signaling the kidneys to rid more of it in the urine.The best sources of calcium (make sure you get enough sunlight) are raw dairy,bone broth/marrow and eggshells.Number 2: Low carb diets.Carbohydrates are the most efficient source of energy we humans have accessto and some cells in the body can only run on carbohydrates.The liver can function optimally only when there are sufficient energy stores ofglycogen.If you go low carb for years, your thyroid will get destroyed since your liver won’thave enough glucose to convert T4 into T3 and since 70% of this conversionhappens only in the liver you will experience hypothyroidism and suboptimalmetabolic health.Low glycogen levels induce stress and this is the main reason why it will beimpossible to get proper sleep on the carnivore diet (again, the carnivore dietdoes not include raw dairy) and your hair will fall out.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",363
Page 140,"Now, first of all, in order for the body to be able to utilize carbohydrates properly,one must restore glucose metabolism as we so prior on this course and do notneglect B vitamins or magnesium.This is crucial.Then he must focus on adding two specific carbohydrates.Number 1: Fruit.Fructose is the fastest way to replenish liver glycogen (by up to 300%) sincefructose is the preferred fuel of the liver and as we said fructose does not requireinsulin to get into the cell.There is a detail though, for the first weeks of someone re-introducing fructoseinto his diet, he must focus first on high potassium fruits.Then after 4 weeks he can eat whatever local and seasonal fruit that he wants to.One sign of fatigued adrenals by the way (given that sodium levels are enoughon one’s diet) is that a person has to urinate almost immediately after consuminga high potassium food or magnesium supplement.Number 2: Honey as God intended to be consumed aka honeycomb.Honeycomb has royal jelly (which will help men convert DHEA into testosteronefaster), bee pollen, propolis and raw honey all at once.From fighting infections to improving heart health,honeycomb is a true superfoodthat should be consumed once or twice a week (don’t over do it) preferably postworkout.Number 3: Gut issuesPart of deiodination happens in the small intestines, so an unhealthy gut willdirectly affect our thyroid performance and our metabolism. This happensbecause thyroid hormone in a healthy gut reacts with acetic acid which activatesit and transforms T4 into T3.If the gut is in a state of dysbiosis and producing very little acetic acid, T3 fails toactivate and thus results in functional hypothyroidism (conversion problems).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",388
Page 141,"Gut health is the foundation of good health in general since every biologicalprocess depends on the gut.Food is first digested in the stomach and small (or upper) intestine where weabsorb as much nutrient potential as possible to prevent competition withbacterial species further down, which consume the same nutrients as we do, andthe remainder which we cannot metabolize is carried on to the farm in the lowerintestine.A healthy gut springs from:0) The proper stomach acid levels (HCL) and healthy digestive enzymes1) Daily deep and restful sleep which we addressed in detail.2) Daily sunlight exposure and the proper vitamin D levels which we addressed.3) Movement4) Addressing bacterial overgrowth5) Addressing deficiencies6) Hydrating the right waySo let’s see these one by one.On stomach acid and digestive enzymesWe will start with stomach acid since this is the number 1 cause for the mostcommon digestive issues (heartburn being one of them which is not caused bytoo much stomach acid).The typical signs of low stomach acid production are:•Bloating•Fatigue•Brain fog•Gas after a meal•Leaky gut•Low B12 levelsⒸHelios_Movement LLC",256
Page 142,"•Undigested food in stool•HeartburnStomach acid production is first of all dependent on the amount of animal proteinand sea salt that’s coming from one’s diet since HCL consists of hydrogen andchloride. Hydrogen is found in meat and chloride is found in sea salt.Besides this, animal protein is high in zinc and B vitamins which are used up bythe stomach cells to produce HCL.Now there are three main problems with B vitamins.The first one is that they are depleted very easily especially when someone isunder stress or fasting chronically.The second one is that 80% of the population (in the US) is estimated to sufferfrom some form of candida, SIBO or H.pylori which all deplete B vitamins.The third and last problem is that they are extremely sensitive to heat and since inthe modern world we tend to overcook everything, we further decrease theamount of B vitamins in foods.So the first step in order to make sure we will not face low stomach acidissues is to have a diet which includes:1.Some raw free range egg yolks (not whites, raw egg whites destroy ourstomach and deplete us of biotin). The key word is “some”. You don’t want yourentire diet to be made out of raw foods. After a certain point, raw animal foods willnot heal your gut but destroy it by feeding pathogenic bacteria.2.Some raw oysters or shellfish if oysters are not possible.3.Medium cooked red meat (you can try stuff such as tartare as well once in awhile) balanced with bone marrow on the side.and4.Sea salt (not himalayan pink salt (it is fortified with inorganic iron which wediscuss in detail later) or any other type of salt).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",393
Page 143,"Salt is important for so many things besides HCL production such as :1.Protein and carbohydrate digestion2.Development of the brain3.Cellular metabolism4.Adrenal function5.Blood volume regulation.The second step of gut healing is addressing B12 in specific.Besides stomach acid secretion, other substances like intrinsic factor (IF) are alsosecreted in the lining of the stomach.This IF has its use in absorbing vitaminB12furtherdown in the small intestine.I usually suggest 2 strategies for fixing B12 deficiency in people who alsowant to heal their gut.Strategy 1: 30-60 grams of organic beef liver 3 times a week for 2-3 weeksstraight and then 200 grams every 7-10 days.The“organic”part is important. The beef liver youwill find in most supermarketswill 100% damage your health through excess iron and heavy metals.If you can find liver from a local small farm though, this can usually be a goodreplacement as well.Just make sure to spice it up with some turmeric and black pepper in order toprevent some iron from being absorbed and since you will not be consuming liverdaily, you will not have to worry about turmeric lowering your DHT.Strategy 2: Supplementing with 500μg of B12 every other day for 10 daysand then 2 times a week.I think that short term supplementation will actually help a lot of people.Just do not over consume B12 (the 1000μg dose most B12 supplements containis too much for most people).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",334
Page 144,"Now when it comes to zinc, the right amount of zinc is critical to intestinal health.For example, daily supplementary therapy with 75 mg elemental zinc has beenshown to cause a significant reduction in the increased intestinal permeability ofCD patients in clinical remission.But zinc supplementation should always be a short term insurance policy and notsomething standar (very few supplements should be a standard in one’s nutritionplan to begin with).Zinc is a mineral so crucial for our gut health that when we consume too little of itthe intestinal barrier literally falls apart. So it’s no wonder why people with a zincdeficiency experience gut problems and serious ones.Zinc supplement can also be a problem long term since zinc depletes manganesevery fast.In nature, every food that’s high in zinc is high in B vitamins or selenium as welland this prevents manganese from being depleted.This is of course not the case for supplements and this is one more reason whywe should avoid them long term.Stomach acid, enzymes and chewing speed.Another thing that is crucial for a healthy gut is the proper eating speed andchewing your food.Chewing stimulates stomach acid and digestive enzymes.So if you are already facing problems with low stomach acid, not chewing yourfood is causing you way more harm than you might think.So try to eat as slow as you can in order to help digestive enzymes.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",303
Page 145,"This step is crucial but very often neglected and without the proper chewingspeed, recovering from low stomach acid production can take a very long time.Note: If you are a fast compulsive eater by the way, chances are that you’refacing some kind of microbial overgrowth (main cause low stomach acid) and youshould add in your diet blackseed oil and other antimicrobial things such asoregano oil which we will later mention.Stomach acid production is dependent on zinc and B vitamins as we said, so adeficiency in these which is very common can also cause a deficiency in stomachacid.Any diet plan in this program will take care of both and if you want to supplementB vitamins, re-read the previous module.Side note: Common symptoms of a B vitamin deficiency are:1)Chronic fatigue2)Inability to concentrate3)Sensitivity to sunlight (skin, not retina)4)IBS5)Insomnia6)Epilepsy7)Thinning hair (different than hair loss)8)Dermatitis9)High PTH + LDL10)Anemia11)Migraines12)ApathyOther things that cause low stomach acid and you should avoid are:• Food additives• Artificial sweeteners• PUFAs• Grains• Legumes• Alcohol• CaffeineⒸHelios_Movement LLC",286
Page 146,"• Poor quality dairy• NSAIDs• Tap water• Oxalates• Phytoestrogens• Nuts and seeds• Not the proper carb:protein:fat ratio for the individual’s blood type• A ton of supplements• Plastic/BPA• Not enough bioavailable calcium• A deficiency in fat soluble vitamins and not enough dietary cholesterol• Poor sleep• Excessive serotoninSo let’s analyze these now.1)Food additivesFood additives are chemicals added to foods to keep them fresh or to enhancetheir color, flavor and texture.They can include things like:-Anti-caking agents (they stop ingredients from becoming lumpy).-Antioxidants (they prevent foods from oxidizing/going rancid).-Artificial sweeteners (increase the sweetness).-Emulsifiers (stop fats from clotting together).-Food acids (they maintain the right acid level).-Colors (they enhance/add color).-Humectants (they keep foods moist).-Flavors and flavor enhancers.-Foaming agents (they maintain uniform aeration of gasses in foods).-Preservatives (they stop microbes from multiplying and spoiling the food).-Thickeners and vegetable gums (they enhance texture and consistency).-Stabilizers and firming agents (they maintain even food dispersion).-Raising agents (they increase the volume of food through the use of gasses).-Bulking agents (they increase the volume of food without major changes to itsavailable energy).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",325
Page 147,"And many other things (MSG etc)Some food additives can be safe in moderation but there are big problems withthings like : artificial sweeteners (worse than GMO sugar), preservatives (food issupposed to rot within a few days), colors, thickeners, bulking agents andvegetable gums.So you must avoid most foods that come in a package, all soft drinks and delimeats.2)Artificial sweetenersNow artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose , saccharin, stevia etcare destroying our gut (*), our liver (**)and lead to wild food cravings down theroad.(*) Artificial sweeteners pass through the human GI tract without being digestedso they come in direct contact with microbes in the colon resulting in makingpreviously healthy gut bacteria to become diseased and invade the gut wall(anyone who has any gut/intestinal issues should stop consuming artificialsweeteners immediately). Artificial sweeteners can also cause glucoseintolerance way faster than GMO sugar a lot of times.And anyone who might struggle with cancer should immediately stop consumingartificial sweeteners since they have been shown to increase the size ofcancerous tumors. Researchers have called aspartame “a multi potentcarcinogenic compound” and have pointed to the many dangers of artificialsweeteners.Artificial sweeteners in some cases can also trigger irritable bowel syndrome andcrohn’s disease in susceptible patients.(**) Studies have shown that increased consumption of artificial sweeteners(especially in soft drinks) leads to lipid (fat) accumulation in the liver, fibrosis, anddegeneration of the liver.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",354
Page 148,"3)PUFAsPUFAs coming from things such as canola oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil and soon, mess with your digestion in a very unique way.They literally destroy our bodies ability to digest food.PUFAs break down into toxic byproducts like HNE, acrolein and MDA whenoxidized (*) resulting in heart attacks , cancer, Alzheimer's , diabetes and theydamage metabolic function (partly by remodeling the cardiolipin structure of themitochondria) and cause cellular death and leakage of potassium.(*)Unsaturated fats are more reactive to oxygen since they lack hydrogen atoms(leading to oxidative stress and disease).Oxidized PUFA can be dangerous when in our bodies, especially since oxidativedamage to fat-containing LDL particles is a primary factor in the development ofheart disease. And an omega-6 rich diet greatly increases oxidized LDL levels.The more PUFA we eat, the more that accumulates in our bodies' adipose tissue.So they age you, increase estrogen ( a MAJOR cause for acne and gut issues)and other stress hormones (which are the primary drive of cancer (cancer cellsalso are known to have very high levels of unsaturated fat and when a diet is richin unsaturated fats, tumors grow very rapidly) and since every cell in your bodyneeds “fat” (every cell membrane is made out of fat/cholesterol), when you’re notconsuming saturated fats but unsaturated fats, your cell membranes will be madeout of these poisons and you’ll have suboptimal protection against harmfuleveryday compounds.So it is best that your fat sources include only things such as: coconut oil, EVOO(extra virgin olive oil but not for cooking), palm kernel oil (not for cooking),avocados, some raw dairy after you’ve healed your gut, grass fed animal fats andin general things that do not need to be processed with petroleum basedchemicals and are high in unsaturated fats.4)GrainsIn modern agriculture, grains are probably the number 2 (soy is probably thenumber 1) thing that is sprayed with enormous amounts of herbicides such asglyphosate. A herbicide linked to cancer and which also leads to environmentalcatastrophes by destroying bee populations.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",493
Page 149,"Glyphosate was introduced to the marketplace in 1974 but data on its use is onlyavailable since 1990.Monsanto has genetically modified foods so that they are resistant to glyphosate,a herbicide Monsanto sells, resulting in a dramatic increase in the use ofglyphosate. The study points out that research has shown that ""glyphosatedisrupts the ability of animals, including humans, to detoxify xenobiotics.This means that exposure to the chemicals in food and the environment, such asendocrine disrupting chemicals and carcinogens, could be causing levels ofdamage that would not occur if the body were able to detoxify them.Modern grains destroy people’s guts and brains. There is zero doubt about it.99.999% of people who go gluten free experience positive health benefits. Alsomost of the modern grains have been through excessive hybridization which endsup making gluten very very hard to digest compared to pre hybridized grains suchas einkorn for example. That’s the whole problem with gluten. That the glutenthat’s coming from modern wheat has nothing to do with the gluten we’ve beeneating for thousands of years.Grains are also high in mycotoxins such as ochratoxin anddeoxynivalenol. Theeffects of mycotoxins on human health can be both acute and chronic, provokingproblems such as liver cancer and respiratory problems. Mycotoxins causepesturbation in the gut, particularly in the intestinal epithelial. Most of the reportedeffects of mycotoxins on human health are negative both short term and longterm.Grains are also high in phytic acid which impairs the body's absorption of iron,zinc, and calcium and can contribute to a lot of mineral deficiencies over time.Glyphosate also holds on things like manganese, magnesium and minerals ingeneral to the point of starving the plant itself. So a) the nutrient content of theplant is low to begin with and b) the phytic acid lowers your body’s storage ofⒸHelios_Movement LLC",444
Page 150,"nutrients (unless the plant is cooked in animal fats but still it only works in asufficient level only with green leafy greens).5)LegumesLegumes usually contain large amounts of lectins, phytic acid, phytoestrogens,cyanogenic glucosides (which interfere with iodine absorption and metabolism) ,isoflavones , and soluble fiber which in large doses can harm the liver. Legumesalso are high in protease inhibitors.Proteases are enzymes that break down proteins.So protease inhibitors are molecules that stop proteases from doing their job andthus legumes should be avoided for at least 12 weeks.6)AlcoholAlcohol damages the stomach and intestinal lining in a really disastrous way.A person can not expect to heal his gut while drinking alcohol.Most alcoholic drinks are also fermented and thus contain a certain form of yeastthat you should stay away from.In your case i suggest cutting back to drinking once a week instead of two times.7)Tap waterTap water contains chlorine, sodium fluoride, microplastics, pesticides,herbicides, atrazine and could even contain things such as heavy metals, rust,birth control pills and antidepressants.So filtering your water is crucial in order to heal your gut.8)PhytoestrogensPhytoestrogens are present in certain edible plants being most abundant in soy,they are structurally and functionally analogous to the estrogen and have alsobeen classified as endocrine disruptors.Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with endocrine (orhormone) systems at certain doses.These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and otherdevelopmental disorders.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",355
Page 151,"Phytoestrogens can manipulate steroid biosynthesis and transport by for examplestimulating SHBG synthesis in liver cells, and displacing either 17β-estradiol ortestosterone from plasma SHBG.This deflection of the quantity or availability of SHBG by phytoestrogens changesthe free fraction of endogenous hormones in circulation systemically or locally.Even though some studies (some of them good and some of them bad) haveshown some benefits for women, it is better to avoid phytoestrogens for men andalso for anyone who is under 21 since some studies have shown increasedinfertility.What you should avoid most :- Soy/Soy products- Flax- Tempeh- Sesame seeds- Beer9)OxalatesOxalic acid is mostly (a lot of grains also contain oxalates) found in leafy greens,nuts, seeds and night shades and our concern with it here is that it inhibitscalcium absorption by binding it, so since most people with gut issues have notenough bioavailable calcium to begin with, they should be avoided for 12 weeksand then consumed only slow cooked in quality animal fats since things such asorganic spinach cooked in tallow for example, can be beneficial once in a while.10)PhytatesPhytic acid plays a role in the development of a plant as a phosphorus store. It isfound in spinach, lentils, legumes, beans,nuts, peanuts, all kinds of seeds, grains,oats, rice and corn. Phytates block the absorption of the nutrients that the plantsstore, which is the basic principle of an antinutrient.11)Dairy productsⒸHelios_Movement LLC",359
Page 152,"Dairy products when the quality is high are probably the most nutritious foods onthe planet but people with gut issues should take a break from them.The amount of carnivores that promoted dairy products to their friends with gutissues to the point of them taking literally 4X the time to heal is ridiculous.Not to mention pasteurized milk and BCM-7 (an opioid peptide which is releasedin order for pasteurized dairy to be digested).Obviously also, a lot of people have dairy intolerances or even allergies and thisshould also not be ignored.An 8 week break from all dairy products while fixing HCL and B12 levels arecrucial in order for someone to be able to properly digest and utilize dairy.12)FastingTaking a break from the wrong kind of foods is, of course, beneficial.But since we are talking about optimizing one’s stomach acid, fasting can becounterproductive since our gut needs stimuli in order to produce enoughstomach acid and that stimuli is of course the right kind of food.When trying to heal the gut, 3 easy digestible meals a day and perhaps a snackon the weightlifting days seem to be the ideal number so stick to the meal planthat will be presented.13)A ton of supplementsIt is not uncommon for people in health spaces to consume 30 differentsupplements a day, not to mention things such as pre workouts, testosteroneboosters, pump enhancers and so on.The problem with this is that most of them contain microplastics, siliconederivatives, soy lecithin and so on and are a burden on the liver as well.50-70% of the supplements out there are not worth it.The ones that are worth it, should be nothing more than specific tools which as aresult should be used under the right circumstances.14)Plastic/BPAPlastic slips in everything nowadays.The average person consumes a credit card every week in microplastics.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",412
Page 153,"Plastic also contains phthalates which areassociated with increased prenatalmortality, reduced growth and birth weight.Some plastic products also contain benzophenones but these are a bigger threatin personal care products since they come in direct contact with our skin.Note: some product’s labels might say “BPA free” but most of them include BPSwhich you should also avoid. Just say no to plastic as much as possible. It’s goodfor the environment too.Avoid eating and drinking out of plastic containers in order to heal your gut (buthealth as well).Also, one more cause for low stomach acid since we are kind of talking aboutxenoestrogens, is toothpastes and mouthwashes since they destroy the mouth'sPH. So sticking to toothpastes made out of natural ingredients and ditchingmouthwash for coconut oil, will be very beneficial.15)Excessive serotoninThere are many ways to get rid of excessive serotonin but not many if yourgut health is not optimal.Here are the safest ways to get rid of excessive serotonin if your gut healthis not optimal.1) GlycineGlycine mitigates the excessive tryptophan (a serotonin agonist) that comes froma lot of animal products and basically aids serotonin clearance.2) Another one is supplementing ginkgo biloba(notwith niacin) which cannormalize elevated catecholamine and lowers serotonin since it has oppositeeffects of serotonin (it increases blood flow to the brain (serotonin reduces it)).3) 2-4 free range whole eggs a day for the choline benefits.Choline increases dopamine receptor densities and can even ameliorate memoryimpairment.4) Do not fast.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",373
Page 154,"Dopamine deficiency which can affect serotonin excess sometimes occurs whenpeople are extremely stressed because adrenaline is actually made fromdopamine.If you’re a fasting maniac, you’re obviously pumping adrenaline like a maniac andthis should be avoided.5)Eat a macronutrient balanced dinner.At night when we are asleep adrenaline is expressed in order to release glycogenfrom tissue storage to keep our organs and metabolism running.If you don’t have any food in your system the adrenaline will lead to all shorts ofmesses which will result in again, dopamine deficiency.6)Mandatory weekly oysters.A promoter of adrenaline excess is zinc deficiency.So never forget to eat your weekly serving of oysters.7)Get on thiamine (B1).Most people are thiamine deficient (both due to the lack of dietary thiamine butalso a compromised gut) and a deficiency in thiamine increases serotoninproduction.A note on sunlight and vitamin DVitamin D levels are crucial for gut health and many people’s gut issues do notresolve because they leave vitamin D unaddressed.Vitamin D influences gut function and lining and is needed to make antimicrobialpeptides and is shown to be protective against numerous infections and diseaseslike parasitic overgrowth.Supplementing vitamin D (in a liquid form) even though it can be very verybeneficial especially for people who have taken lots of antibiotics in their life(antibiotics mess up some of the enzymes that help vitamin D from beingabsorbed in the gut and a solution for this is to start adding some pectins in thediet), can not substitute sunlight.A common cause for gut issues in general but also bacterial overgrowth inspecific, is unbound iron.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",374
Page 155,"Unbound iron results in all sorts of trouble when it comes to gut health.It not only feeds very effectively pathogenic species but it also kills beneficialones.Some pathogenic species can also only feed on iron.The biggest heavy metal issue we face today is unbound iron.Most people today consume way too many PUFAs and their iron homeostasis isfar from optimal.This results in a lot of oxidative stress and thus metabolic problems.Copper, vitamin C and vitamin E are the main regulators of iron homeostasis.If you are not a child you need very little iron to maintain health and obviously notthe kind of raw metal shavings which are added to iron fortified foods such ascommon wheat.Unbound iron can destroy your entire metabolism (and thus cause cancer,Alzheimer’s and many other diseases) like nothing else.Iron is highly unstable unless properly bound and buffered by some specificproteins such as lactoferrin.To put it simply the problem is not iron itself exactly but when it's present in itsfree form because due to its ability to participate in redox reactions, iron is acatalyst for the formation of hydroxyl radicals from reduced forms of O2.Reducing excess iron will help someone with all sorts of niche health areas suchas heal cancer, hair-loss, acne, eczema, insomnia, ED, chronic fatigue and so on.Unbound iron contributes to illnesses through the promotion of bacteria andviruses which need iron in order to replicate.This alters our microbiota and feeds pathogenic species of bacteria which excretetoxic compounds that destroy our internal organs.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",346
Page 156,"Surprisingly, one of the most common causes of bloating when consuming grainsis not gluten (which i am not a fun of in hybridized grains but more about this inlesson 2), but the iron that they fortify the cereals with.But what about anemia?Doesn’t an anemic person need to consume more iron?The short answer is no.Anemia in 99% of the cases is not actually caused by a lack of iron in the diet buta deficit of the vitamins and nutrients which are involved in the metabolism of ironwith the most common ones being vitamin A, vitamin D, biotin and vitamin Cwhich is required to keep iron in a biologically soluble state.What can we do about unbound iron?First of all be patient since regulating iron homeostasis can take up to a year andthis illustrates that iron homeostasis is not something to be taken lightly.Step 1: Stop consuming iron fortified foods (avoid all grains) and stop consumingfoods extremely high in iron for 3 months.Step 2: Add blackseed oil in your diet since it is the only natural antibiotic that willnot harm the friendly bacteria. Antibiotics are useful under this context since theybind to iron preventing it being used by bacteria.This will also help you with any candida overgrowth you might be facing.Step 3: Start adding in your diet the following foods: pineapple, carrots, squash,pumpkin and cooked garlic/onions/broccoli since sulfur strongly binds to excessiron.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",323
Page 157,"Step 4: Start adding turmeric and black pepper to meats that are high in iron oncein a while.Step 5: Consider supplementing with 200-500mg of vitamin C that is coming fromwhole foods and 50-100mg of thiamine for up to 4 weeks 3-5 days of the week,since both of these is crucial for iron regulation and the excretion of any extra ironthrough the skin and urine (if you have too much unbound iron and supplementthiamine, you might find that you smell bad after about 45-90 minutes ofconsuming it (the same implies with things such as onions and if you break out(not in hives, a couple of pimples) when you consume onions or thiamine, youhave a lot of unbound iron). Vitamin C will help remove iron that is stored in thetissues and prevent it from oxidizing.Step 6: The weekly oysters should take care of any zinc deficiency that might bepresent and cause an iron excess.Step 7: Consider supplementing a low dose of riboflavin (B2) since it can preventpathogenic bacteria from using iron.Step 8: Biweekly beef liver since vitamin A stimulates the release of iron that isstored in the tissues.Step 9: No alcohol for 4-12 weeks since alcohol stimulates the increased uptakeof iron by tissues.On movementFirst of all, movement matters for digestion because it stimulates gastric fluids.If you have trouble digesting your food, besides removing the wrong things fromyour diet and adding the right ones, a 5-15 minute walk post meal can severelyhelp your digestion.According to WHO 60 to 85% of people in the world live sedentary lifestyles.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",363

Page 159,"Addressing pathogens, SIBO and candida the right wayHistamine and bacteria overgrowthMost approaches when it comes to addressing bacteria overgrowth fail for avariety of reasons but one very common is that they do not address histamineand mast cells.Not only that, but a lot of times when people blame things such as a flaky scalpon candida for example, they fail to understand that the underlying cause couldvery possibly be a histamine reaction.Otherwise why do a good portion of the people who supplement flush niacin(niacin supplementation is a complicated topic that will be addressed later),experience severe flaky and dry skin on their scalp even within minutes ofsupplementing niacin?This is for example also why many people’s guts have such horrific reactionswhen it comes to eating foods such as spinach.Spinach, if it’s slow cooked in animal fats and is not overconsumed, can actuallygreatly help a lot of people’s gut since vitamin K will address the excessiveoxygen in the gut that things such as unbound iron can create.The problem is not spinach per say, the problem is that spinach is very very highin histamines.Histamine is a molecule produced in our bodies by decarboxylation of the aminoacid histidine.It is distributed throughout all tissues but it is particularly concentrated in the skin.lungs and GI tract.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",305
Page 160,"Histamine is generated and stored within granules in mast cells (*) located withinthe tissues basophils and eosinophils circulating in the blood andenterochromaffin-like cells located in the stomach lining.(*)A mast cell is a type of white blood cell and is found in connective tissuesthroughout your body. Mast cells help your immune system function properly andnormally help protect us from disease.Mast cells are key components in the inflammatory response as they can beactivated to release a wide variety of inflammatory mediators, by many differentantigens including allergens, pathogens and physiological mediators.Mast cells synthesize and secrete histamine, proteases,prostaglandin D2,leukotrienes, heparin and a variety of cytokines.Mast cells play an important role in how the immune system responds to certainbacteria and parasites and they help control other types of immune responses.Histamine intolerance (something very common in people with skin and gutissues) is a condition in which your body cannot degrade high amounts ofhistamine due to inadequate levels of enzymes called diamine oxidase.Histamine intolerance can also cause sleep problems, thyroid issues and hairloss besides gut and skin issues.Histamine intolerance is not something that you have to carry around for alifetime in case we are not talking about serious allergies.But why do we care about histamines when it comes to gut health?It’s because bacteria produce histamines.Bacteria are able to synthesize and secrete histamine so if you increase thehistamine responses through diet and lifestyle, you will be feeding these bacteriawithout even knowing it.So the first step is to minimize the histamine response.Here’s how we are going to do this.Step 1: Avoid all of the following foods for 4-12 weeksⒸHelios_Movement LLC",398
Page 161,"1) No kefir2) No cheeses (especially parmesan)3) No canned foods4) No chocolate5) No soy6) No nuts7) No mustard8) No tomatoes9) No cured meats10) No dried fruit11) No preservatives12) No additives13) No bananas14) No yogurt15) No kimchi16) No kombucha17) No coffee18) No vinegar, (especially the ones with the mother)19) No sourdough20) No alcohol.Also avoid too much olive oil.Step 2: Also avoid histamine liberators(*) such as cabbage and too much stress.(*)Histamine liberators are things that trigger the release of the body's existinghistamine.Do your best to minimize stress since the more cortisol you have,the morehistamine reaction you have.Note:This is why antihistamines make a lot of people sleepy and make themsleep a lot. It’s because they were running on cortisol and adrenaline.Step 3: Only eat freshly cooked meals.When foods sit, the bacteria break down histidine into histamine.Step 4: Add foods that stabilize mast cells (how antihistamine drugs work).These include:●Chamomile●Turmeric●Ginger●Apples (skin off in order to avoid the pesticides and herbicides)ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",292
Page 162,"●Peaches (skin off)Step 5: Add mast cell inhibitorsThe best natural solutions are :1)QuercetinQuercetin inhibits the mast cells and stabilizes cortisol.Quercetin is fat soluble so you’ll need to consume it with a fatty meal in order toincrease the absorption.Quercetin has a half life of 2 hours, so after the first 2 days that you’ll take it oncein order to see if you have some negative reaction to it, you’re going to up it to 3times a day.Note: Yes, low levels of zinc can lead to a histamine intolerance since the zincchelator N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN) inhibits therelease of histamine, the production of cytokines, and the secretion of lipidmediators in mast cells but remember what we said about zinc supplements.2)A teaspoon of black cumin seed oil 2 times a day with meals.Black cumin seed oil has great antihistamine effects and is one of the moststudied natural remedies that has been utilized for its medicinal properties forover two thousand years.Blackseed oil is superior to all other natural anti microbiotics for one more reason.When things such as oregano oil wipe out all pathogenic microorganisms (thisincludes the good strains of bacteria as well), black cumin seed oil attacks thepathogenic and spoilage bacteria but not good strains such as lactobacillus.Addressing SIBOSIBO or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is a condition that marks anabundance of bad bacteria in the small intestine causing bloating and all kinds ofdigestive distress besides malabsorption of nutrients.Tips to beat SIBOGo and test your vitamin B12 levels, if they are not very high and you experiencea lot of fatigue, supplement a small dose (250μγ) of B12 every other day for evenup to 4 weeks since a B12 deficiency is probably the most influential cause ofSIBO.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",449
Page 163,"Your diet can only include: coconut oil, EVOO, blackseed oil, free range eggs,meat, sea salt, some turmeric, black pepper, white fish, organ meats, low GIfruits, some bone marrow or grass fed gelatin and some bone broth rice.You can supplement with now food’s candida support (it’s a good supplement forSIBO also) 3-5 days a week for a couple of weeks. Then take a 1-2 weekmandatory break.Binders such as apple pectin and activated charcoal will also help you.Also do not even think about training in a fasted state since it will increase gutpermeability and allow endotoxins to enter into the circulation.In the case of SIBO, taking digestive enzymes with meals can help you as well.Mastic gum can also be a good tool but do not start with it.Short term thiamine supplementation (with some fruit) can also greatly help sincethiamine stimulates the oxidation of carbohydrate for energy which results in theproduction of CO2 which in turn binds and detoxifies ammonia.Zinc and C02 also become depleted by high levels of ammonia so always keepfruit and oysters in your diet.B3 supplementation, performed the way that you will read later in this lesson, isalso a very powerful tool for SIBO.Note: Eating quality intestines will of course also help you heal intestines in caseyou can find quality ones. Obviously, cook the intestines.CandidaCandida overgrowth is a yeast infection that usually leads to digestive and skinproblems besides the typical intense brain fog.You should eliminate grains, PUFAs, sugar, artificial sweeteners, fermentedfoods, ALL dairy products and you should basically do a: meat, eggs, (some)white fish, low GI fruit, you can have in moderation some types of honey such asraw honey and manuka honey formethylglyoxal (an antibacterialcompound),blackseed oil, avocado, coconut oil, (some) organ meats and (some) rice.Iodine supplementation can be helpful but very tricky and as always start with avery very small amount of any supplement and never forget that they are shortterm tools which if you use long term, you will face problems.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",484
Page 164,"We cycle a lot of iodine and you should never supplement iodine daily or formonths at a time.In both cases (sibo and candida) address unbound iron as you will see in theheavy metal detox part.Bacteria also require sufficient environmental methionine to grow, this means thatafter you have taken a break from any foods that might be triggering histamine fora few weeks, adding bone marrow, grass fed gelatin and glycine, could greatlyhelp you heal your gut.Candida also can harvest calcium from food or even our tissues to buffer itselfagainst things like histatin as well as stomach acid.In order to improve this problem, plenty of sunshine, vitamins K1, K2 and B12(from whole foods, the supplementation must always be short term) are crucial.Now it is worth mentioning that some people with candida have benefited fromraw almonds. I’m against most (unsprouted nuts), but you can try to eat 7almonds (no more) a day for a week and see if it helps you.And again, short term thiamine supplementation (with some fruit) can also helpsince thiamine stimulates the oxidation of carbohydrate for energy which resultsin the production of CO2 which in turn binds and detoxifies ammonia.After you’ve implemented what we’ve discussed so far, you can also greatlybenefit from taking apple pectin every once in a while (2-3 days per week).Since apple pectin cannot be metabolized into lactic acid, it is a very effective toolto promote metabolic health in general and it also helps the absorption ofmagnesium and lower excess histamine.The best way to take apple pectin is 20-40 minutes before a meal.It takes 2-5 weeks to get noticeable benefits from apple pectin*Hydrating the proper way (cellular hydration)Being hydrated is one of the key components of gut mobility.There’s more to hydration than ""drinking a gallon of water a day"" or any similaradvice that can be counterproductive most of the time since too much water willdissolve minerals, dehydrate us and will dilute stomach acid.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",464
Page 165,"Cellular hydration is a term which refers to how much water reaches and isutilized by your cells.Being properly hydrated is crucial for every aspect of our health.Take free radicals for example.An atom or group of atoms with an unpaired electron is called a free radical.It can steal electrons from a stable molecule, creating a new free radical andinitiating a chain reaction. This electron-grabbing is called oxidation and can set up a chain reaction,creating new free radicals and damaging important molecules along the way.Now if we are properly hydrated, the hydrogen in water will deactivate freeradicals and clear them from our system.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",148

Now let's see how to properly hydrate yourselves.First we have electrolytes.Without the proper amount of electrolytes, water will not be absorbed by the cellsbut linger between the walls of the cells.Electrolytes dissolve in water and give it the ability to conduct electricity.The most important electrolytes are:1)Sodium2)ChlorideⒸHelios_Movement LLC",162

It's the ultimate endocrine disruptor cocktailand must be avoided.An underrated hydration tool is optimizing one's glucose metabolism since whenexcess glucose builds up in our blood it will be excreted into our urine which willdeplete fluids from our tissues (reason why diabetics are so thirsty).Number 4: Harmed NAD+ homeostasis.Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and its metabolites, function asregulators to enable the plastic cells to adapt to environmental changes includingnutrient perturbation, genotoxic factors, circadian disorder, infection, inflammationand xenobiotics as we said prior.Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and related coenzymes play criticalroles in liver function. NAD+ metabolism controls the redox homeostasis.Imagine that NAD(P)+/NAD(P)H represents the switching hub that controlsprooxidant-antioxidant balance and determines redox biology.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",240
Page 170,"The redox status can be defined as the balance between oxidants (orpro-oxidants) and antioxidants.Oxidants, including free radicals and other reactive species, are continuouslyproduced in the cell.As it is impossible to completely prevent oxidant production, several antioxidantsystems have evolved in the cell.Cells continuously generate oxidants and produce antioxidants.In order to maintain a healthy status, oxidants and antioxidants should be inequilibrium. However, this equilibrium is very difficult to maintain in the cell. Whenthis equilibrium between oxidant and antioxidant is disrupted, tilting theequilibrium toward an oxidized state, oxidative stress is produced.Oxidative stress is involved in the physiopathology of several diseases, includingcardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and many others. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",173
Page 171,"Oxidative stress compounds conversion problems and hypothyroidism is ingeneral a state of increased oxidative stress.The way to address this is to optimize NAD+ homeostasis and supportglutathione.If someone has read and implemented what we have discussed so far, NAD+homeostasis is already in the rehab process and the only thing someone needsto do extra is pay more attention to targeted niacinamide supplementation.B vitamins make all the enzymatic and energetic processes that govern thecreation and direction of energy.Niacin is the most important B vitamin for this process (if B1 for example isresponsible for let’s say 25-35% of this process, niacin is responsible for 35-50%)because it is a NAD precursor. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",173
Page 172,"In mammals, NAD+ is synthesized from four precursors: tryptophan, nicotinic acid(pyridine-3-carboxylic acid), nicotinamide (nicotinic acid amide), nicotinamidemononucleotide (NMN) and nicotinamide riboside (NR).Without these, NAD+ homeostasis is impossible and since NAD’s function in thebody is to shuttle electrons from processes which obtain energy from food tothose which then use that energy, an optimal metabolism will be impossible toobtain as well which means that we are talking now about increased chances ofserious metabolic diseases such as cancer since without NAD the body cannotrun the higher metabolic systems which define health.Without NAD+, the gap between eating food and using it as energy can not becovered.BUT, healing the gut is a non negotiable if someone wants his body to be able toproperly absorb niacin (and every other nutrient).No matter the dietary niacin amounts that someone might consume, if his guthealth is suboptimal, the niacin levels in his body will be insufficient and thus theNAD levels will be as well (again, niacin is needed to form NAD).A lot of people consume enough animal products in order to get their B vitaminsin but they still experience a deficiency in many of them and this usually is due togut dysbiosis, thus one should focus on healing his gut for up to 16 weeks inorder for his body to be able to properly absorb B vitamins.Supplementing niacinamide for up to 8 weeks (never supplement niacinamide formore than 8 weeks) can be beneficial if a person’s metabolism is harmed, but itshould be done very carefully meaning that a person should follow a set of ruleswhen supplementing niacin/niacinamide and if he does not, he could even harmthe kynurenine pathway.Rule 1:Make sure you have enough vitamin A, magnesium,copper, glycine,glutamine, zinc and B2 in your system before you even consider supplementingniacinamide.This means that bone marrow/bone broth, magnesium glycinate or citrate,brewer’s yeast (you can take brewer’s yeast daily), a biweekly dose of 100gr ofbeef liver and weekly oysters should be consumed for 3-4 weeks before a personstarts supplementing niacin.Instead of supplementing niacinamide for these weeks, a person should focus onwhole food sources of niacin such as: figs, raw dairy and some homemade speltor einkorn bread but only after at least 3 months of not consuming any grains.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",582
Page 173,"You need bone marrow as a source of aminos since when a person is sufferingfrom conversion/metabolic problems, the rate of the conversion of tryptophan toniacin and NAD slows down, which causes an increase in tryptophan and excesstryptophan can cause severe derangements in someone’s metabolism and beconverted to torporific hormones such as serotonin.So the best solution(s) for this is to balance the amino acid profile in someone’sdiet by consuming bone marrow or even collagen.Do not ignore these.Rule 2:Never supplement niacin on an empty stomach.In order for niacin supplementation to improve our metabolic rate, we need tosupply the nutrients required to run the kynurenine pathway and ignite themetabolism before consuming niacinamide in a supplemental form.An example of a meal that could be eaten in order to optimize the utilization ofsupplemental niacin is free range eggs cooked in coconut oil, seasonal fruit,some beta carotene from pumpkin or squash, a small piece of honeycomb andsome taurine (taurine directly increases conversion of tryptophan to niacinamide)or in case you want to drink coffee, a small cup of coffee.If you can also wash the niacinamide with a little bone broth that will be idealalso.Rule 3:Why are you supplementing 500mg of niacin?The niacin flush, should be invigorating and pleasant, not a torture.For this reason, even a dose of 100mg might be too much in the beginning.If that’s the case, then the person instead of supplementing niacinamide, shouldfocus on dietary consumption of B3 rich foods that were mentioned and aspresented in rule 2 but with the extra supplementation of taurine which will alsoallow him to consume every once in a while food like poultry which are notgenerally recommended if a person’s metabolic health is suboptimal but can bebeneficial in some cases.In general, if a) the niacin flush is a torture you have overdone it and b) you cannot feel the pleasant effects of niacin in 30-45 minutes, you either consumed asmall ammount or did something wrong (did not eat enough or did not exposureyourself to sunlight afterwards (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is a highlyphotosensitive molecule)).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",521
Page 174,"Now let’s talk about glutathione since a lack of antioxidant activity may result inthyroid damage from hydrogen peroxide every time Iodine is processed by thethyroid.Glutathione is a substance made from the amino acids glycine, cysteine, andglutamic acid. It is produced by the liver andisresponsible for detoxification andthyroid hormone conversion.Glutathione plays a role in many chemical reactions in our body, helps detoxifychemicals and protects our mitochondria against oxidative stress.Lower glutathione levels appear to go hand-in-hand with poor thyroid functionsince glutathione pathways help the conversion of T4 to T3.Glutathione is an antioxidant dependent on selenium and produced in the cytosolof the cell.How to boost glutathione production 1011)Consume sulfur rich foodssuch as fish, beef, onions,garlic, shallots andbroccoli once in a while after you’ve healed your gut.2)Consume vitamin C and E rich foods.Vitamin C maintainsthe body’s supplyof antioxidants, including glutathione and helps reprocess glutathione byconverting oxidized glutathione back to its active form.Good sources of dietary vitamin C are: berries, kiwis, pomegranates, grapefruits,orange juice (no pulp), berrie juice (no pulp).Good sources of vitamin E are EVOO and organic palm kernel oil.3)Consume selenium rich foods.Selenium is a glutathionecofactor, meaningit’s a substance needed for glutathione activity and will lead to increasedglutathione peroxidase levels.Good dietary sources of selenium are: beef, fish, organ meats and Brazil nuts.4)Start adding turmeric in your meals once in a while.Numerous animal andtest-tube studies have shown that turmeric and curcumin extract have the abilityto increase glutathione levels. Just make sure to add some black pepper toturmeric to help the absorption.5)Other important nutrients that our body needs to make and recycleglutathione are:magnesium, zinc, B vitamins, glycineand glutamine which canall be found in animal products such as organs, oysters, free range eggs andbone marrow, brewer’s yeast and some sprouted white rice cooked in bone broth.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",521
Page 175,"If you choose to supplement NAC in order to boost glutathione just know that itwill deplete copper levels and should be avoided long term.Number 5: Toxic loadsNowadays toxins are everywhere and one of the organs that affect the most isthe thyroid since it has one of the highest rates of blood flow in our bodies.These toxic loads will be properly addressed in the xenoestrogen and heavymetal detox part.Number 6: Stressful statesStress will directly suppress thyroid production. Stress hormones such as cortisoltear down the thyroid, adrenals and other endocrine glands (adrenaline depletesglycogen stores) and stressful states should be avoided.So here are 4 simple dietary rules you need to follow in order to preventthese states.Number 1:Stick to your maintenance calories.Overeating and undereating are both big stressors.Overeating can lead to chronically elevated levels of the free fatty acids andundereating just makes you a vessel for cortisol.Which will result in blood glucose dysregulation, wrecked hormones and evenmore stress down the road.(We should mention though that under-eating is way worse than over-eatingthough. Way worse.)Most people's caloric needs can get covered via 3 meals a day.Number 2: Keep B vitamins and magnesium at hand.If you have never supplement any B vitamins or magnesium, now is the time todo it because the foods which will help you “battle” stress from a biologicalstandpoint will have carbs.The foods that will help you battle stress effectively are: free range whole eggs,freshly squeezed grapefruit juice (no pulp and add some sea salt to it), local andseasonal fruit and raw milk with local raw honey.So always keep some fruit and eggs in hand as a snack.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",381
Page 176,"Number 3: Do not go low on either carbs or protein.The ideal number for protein seems to be 1.7gr per KG of body weight and forcarbs to be around 30-40% of your total calories.Number 4: Make sure to consume enough vitamin C and copper throughfoods such as organ meats and berries.But doNOTcombine high iron foods such as organ meatsand beef with foodshigh in vitamin C.You need vitamin C under this context (stressful states) since it prevents theexcessive oxidation of adrenaline and the adrenal glands which are probablyalready in a fatigued state, concentrate more vitamin C than any other organ inthe body (except the pituitary).We mentioned the need for carbs when it comes to thyroid performance but weforgot to mention fats and protein.Ditching bad fats such as canola oil, sunflower oil and so on as we will address inPUFA detox is also crucial for thyroid recovery and adding good fats such ascoconut oil, cocoa butter, grass fed butter and ghee, tallo, raw dairy and evenshea butter in one’s diet is necessary for the remodeling of tissues.Cells need good fats and they should not be neglected because without good fatsour cells won’t rebuild properly.If you don’t know which fat source to start with, start with coconut oil since it willstimulate the production of pregnenolone and if provided with enough vitamin Athrough the doses of beef liver that were mentioned, it will greatly help thyroidperformance.A sufficient protein intake is also important for thyroid performance since manyamino acids found in protein participate in pathways which regulate thyroidfunction and the body synthesizes many hormones with protein.Forbidden food list:-Vegetable oils-Peanuts, cashews and every nut except the occasional brazil nuts and possiblysprouted almonds.-Fish oils-High muscle meat diet that is not combined with bone broth/bone marrowⒸHelios_Movement LLC",416

PUFA detoxIf you take 95% of today’s packaged foods that are in any food store and look atthe ingredient list, you’ll notice that they contain some kind of seed oil in themand the question is why?How did a failed soap project (literally) end up on our plates?ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",261
Page 189,"First of all, calling seed oils “oils” is a lie. They are not oils. If you take a bunch ofolives and squeeze them you can get actual “oil” out of them but if you take abunch of seeds and squeeze them you’ll get nothing.So how are these corporations making oils out of seeds exactly?Well first, they gather the seeds they want to make an “oil” out of, such as GMOsoy, cotton , rapeseed etc.Then these “seeds” are heated to extremely high temperatures obviously causingthe seeds to oxidize creating extremely powerful and cancerous byproducts.(Something that should not be ignored since cancer patients can not possiblyrecover from cancer if they keep eating seed oils. Seed oils can also directlycause cancer since they destroy our metabolism and cancer is a metabolicdisease at its core).Then the seeds are processed with apetroleum-basedsolvent such as hexaneto maximize the amount of “oil” extracted from them.Next they use more chemicals to deodorize the oils since they smell horrendousand finally more chemicals are added to improve their color.Now how is this actually good for us?We’re consuming cheap gasoline for God’s shakes but yet this poison is hiddeneverywhere these days.Cottonseed oil (a common seed “oil”) in several studies decreased the lifespan ofmice in half. HALF.Not only that, but it made them severely sick for their entire lifespan. Their qualityof life was pretty bad. They were in a zombie-like state.You don’t need to know that seed oils are high in PUFAs which break down intotoxic byproducts like HNE, acrolein and MDA when oxidized resulting in heartattacks , cancer, Alzheimer's , diabetes and damaging metabolic function ingeneral in order to learn from experience that they harm you.If you want to understand what causes disease and what promotes health, startthinking in terms of what promotes and what harms metabolic health. This shouldbe our number 1 criteria.So since seed oils remodel the cardiolipin structure of mitochondria (the energycenters of the cell) causing cellular death and leakage of potassium they destroyour metabolism and should be avoided.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",491
Page 190,"You’ve probably also heard the terms saturated and unsaturated fat.Seed oils are unsaturated fats which are more reactive to oxygen since they lackhydrogen atoms (leading to oxidative stress and disease).Oxidized PUFA can be dangerous when in our bodies, especially since oxidativedamage to fat-containing LDL particles is a primary factor in the development ofheart disease. And an omega-6 rich diet greatly increases oxidized LDL levels.The more PUFA we eat, the more that accumulates in our bodies' adipose tissue.So they age you, increase estrogen and other stress hormones (which are theprimary drive of cancer (cancer cells also are known to have very high levels ofunsaturated fat and when a diet is rich in unsaturated fats, tumors grow veryrapidly) and since every cell in your body needs “fat” (every cell membrane ismade out of fat/cholesterol), when you’re not consuming saturated fats butunsaturated fats, your cell membranes will be made out of these poisons andyou’ll have suboptimal protection against harmful everyday compounds.Seed oils/PUFAs also mess with your digestion in a very unique way. Theyliterally destroy our bodies ability to digest food.Not just seed oils. ANY food resulting in insufficient absorption of nutrients andsickness as a result of that.Your digestion is the tool our body has in order to absorb everything it needs inorder to function properly. If our digestion is messed up, we become dysfunctionalbe defaultIn Israel there is a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, noninsulin dependent diabetes, obesity, autoimmune diseases(*) and cancer whichseems to be caused by PUFAs since there is a lack of other environmentalpollutants and habits that could lead to these diseases (you can look up “theIsrael paradox”).(*)PUFAs weaken the immune system's function in ways that are similar to thedamage caused by radiation.Notice that diabetes is included there. Seed oils/PUFAs are a bigger cause fordiabetes than sugar. We’re obviously not crazy for stating that. It’s not rocketscience if you understand that seed oil consumption destroys your ability tometabolize carbs in general.It goes back to the fact that they cause oxidative destruction of mitochondriawhich oxidize carbohydrates for energy.PUFA metabolites (leukotrienes) might even trigger Type 1 diabetes whichis anautoimmune condition (the beta-cells of the pancreas get attacked by the immuneⒸHelios_Movement LLC",538
Page 191,"system and over time this leads to their destruction and inability to produceinsulin).PUFA metabolites may also drive lots of bacterial infections and make peopleresistant to already very strong antibiotics which destroy their microbiomes.PUFA consumption has been shown to greatly affect mood disorders also.Linoleic acid increases the expression of nuclear factor NF-kB, the transition ofNF-kB stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokines which have a negative impact onthe CNS. So PUFA might not only affect existing mood disorders but also causethem.Unfortunately one common seed oil that is hidden in a lot of products is soybeanoil which besides causing metabolic disease can severely affect and exacerbateautism, Alzheimer’s, panic disorders and once again depression.One more thing that is worth mentioning is that PUFAs greatly decrease yourbody’s ability to produce thyroid hormones (this is one of the reason why butter“alternatives” for example that are filled with canola oil usually, lead to a massiveincrease of LDL in even a couple of months of consuming them since high serumcholesterol 99.99999% of the time is a sign of hypothyroidism).Now by stating that seed oils are bad, we’re not saying that every single one ofthem is bad for your health. Blackseed oil for example can be a miraculous healthtool for some conditions.When we mention seed oils from now on please keep in mind that we’re referringto oils such us: sunflower oil, almond oil, canola oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil,corn oil, flaxseed oil, rapeseed oil and in general oils that did not exist 2000 yearsago.PUFAs in nature exist with a pretty high dose of vitamin E as well.So a food high in bioavailable vitamin E such as palm kernel oil or a qualityvitamin E supplement are useful for most people in this day and age sinceeveryone has unconsciously been consuming seed oils for years and our body’sneed for vitamin E (and also C) when that happens skyrocket.How inferior fats such as canola oil cause heart disease 101A free radical reacts with a fatty acid and steals one of its electrons.The fatty acid then becomes a free radical that can react with another fatty acidnearby.

Page 194,"●Blood sugar regulation- PUFAs can damage the cells in your pancreasthat produce insulin. If you want to lose body fat and achieve a high levelof health, you want a very effective blood sugar handling system. PUFAscan damage this system. For those with blood sugar handling issues theprimary focus is usually reduced sugar intake, however, I believe it makesmore sense to reduce PUFAs from your diet.●Skin health- PUFAs are closely linked to age pigmentformation. Inaddition, a high level of PUFA in your body means when you are exposedto the sun, free radical damage is more likely.●Metabolism- PUFAs can stress various systems in yourbody, particularlythe rate at which our cells produce energy (aka our metabolism). This hasnumerous implications for thyroid health and general hormonal balance.●Digestion / Immune System- PUFAs can impair proteindigestion.Digestion problems are rampant in this day and age, eliminating PUFAsare an often overlooked and very effective way at supporting digestion.Your immune system is closely linked to your digestive system, a problemwith digestion almost guarantees a poorly functioning immune system.●Detoxification- The liver plays a major role in detoxification,PUFAs canoverburden the liver. That sluggish feeling you feel after eating out? Youmay have just consumed PUFAs.Plan of Action●Avoid PUFA oils to the best of your ability, especially for cooking.●Always use heat stable fats for cooking (i.e. coconut oil, ghee, butter,tallow).●Limit the amount of times per week you eat out.●If you consume animal products ensure that the animals are not fed anyPUFA. This means consuming grass-fed beef and pasture raised eggs andpoultry.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",386
Page 195,"●Vitamin E will help offset the damage caused by PUFAs so make sure tohave some palm kernel oil in your house.●Do not neglect saturated fats since they can offset the damage caused byPUFAs.●Do not neglect vitamin C.●Visit the sauna 2-3 times per week.●Slowly lose some fat if you are above 13% bf for men and 15% for women.PUFAs can also decrease testosterone by up to 300ng/dL.Let’s see why.PUFAs and Leydig cellsLeydig cells are cells located in the testes of the male gonads.They are known as testicular interstitial cells and can be found betweenseminiferous tubules, which contain Sertoli and germ cells.Together, these three cell types maintain spermatogenesis, control hormonalregulation, and affect secondary sexual characteristics in males.Leydig cells are under hormonal regulation by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.These cells can be associated with some pathologic changes or cancerousmalformation.Leydig cells are the primary source of testosterone or androgens in males.This physiology allows them to play a crucial role in many vital physiologicalprocesses in males, including sperm production or spermatogenesis, controllingsexual development, and maintaining secondary sexual characteristics andbehaviors.Now the free radicals that polyunsaturated fatty acids create, will damage theLeydig cells and cause a drop in testosterone levels by even up to 30% in 21 day.

ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",103

Page 198,"First of all, what vitamins and minerals protect us against all of these?1) Zinc (counteracts the toxicity of mercury, lead and aluminum and plays a keyrole in iron homeostasis).2) Selenium (counteracts the toxicity of mercury and lead).3) Vitamin C (NOT combined with foods high in iron) ( plays key role in ironhomeostasis)4) Magnesium (protects cells against all heavy metals).5) Copper (Copper is one of the main regulators of iron).So a few dietary tools against heavy metals are:Pomegranates,berries, beefliver with turmeric and black pepper (to prevent the absorption of excess iron),oysters, raw dairy, some brazil nuts, magnesium glycinate, and cacao.Now let’s see these metals one by one in more detail.Heavy metal number 1: LeadLead is a neurotoxin. A neurotoxin acts on the nervous system and disrupts thenormal function of nerve cells. Lead is also associated with major depression,reduced IQ and anxiety disorder.Lead also disturbs the balance of the oxidant-antioxidant system (see redox onchapter 1.1) and thus induces inflammatory responses in many organs via directeffect on membrane lipid peroxidation.Lead can enter your home in various ways, one of these being your water line.This is true especially for older homes that might have lead solder and when thewater sits in copper pipes for any length of time, the lead used to join the pipescan break down and make its way to your kitchen sink or bathtub.So, in order to minimize exposure to lead you should first invest in a water filter inorder to filter the water that you drink and cook your foods in, but you should filteryour showering water.As we shower, heat opens up our pores allowing trace amounts of toxins to beabsorbed through our skin.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",405
Page 199,"In general, our skin is a sponge and we should be very careful when it comes towhat we put on it.Always remember that without a water filter your kidneys will become the filter.Then, lead can also be found in coloured ceramic dishes and spices that comefrom India and China.The solutions to these are to buy wooden bowls and find spices that come fromLatin America if you live nearby or local ones.Another thing you should avoid if you do not want to consume lead, is foodadditives.For reducing blood lead levels the most important things to consume are:1)Raw milk ( calcium is well known to decrease gastrointestinal lead absorption)2)Thiamine (B1) which is a chelator for most of the heavy metals3)Folate (B9)4)Sulfur rich foods such as onions since heavy metals in general have an affinityto bind sulfur5) Vitamin ENote: Lead can also cause anemia, so in case someone’s anemia is not reactiveto the traditional methods of treatment (given that both B vitamin and vitamin Cstores are optimal) there might be an underlying lead exposure going on.Heavy metal number 2: CadmiumCadmium is classified as a known human carcinogen and causes severe damageto someone's kidneys and lungs.Symptoms to be aware of when it comes to cadmium are sudden and intenseweight loss, hypertension, vomiting and diarrhea.In order to avoid the most common sources of cadmium for most people, ditchbreakfast cereal and breakfast grains in general ( the only thing you can consumeafter 16 weeks of this program is organic oat bran with some coconut oil, cacaoⒸHelios_Movement LLC",356
Page 200,"and raw milk in order to reduce endotoxins).and pay attention to the tobacco youconsume.But cadmium exposure besides the above is very unlikely unless you smokeshady tobacco brands (the very unregulated and very cheap ones) which arecontaminated with cadmium and should be avoided by a) quitting smoking or b) ifyou are going to smoke stick to organic tobacco.Raw milk will help battle a possible cadmium toxicity.Note: If you are considering using dmsa for heavy metals, please consult yourdoctor first and get hair and blood tests to see if you actually have heavy metalpoisoning.Heavy metal number 3: AluminumAluminum is another neurotoxin which can pass the blood brain barrier veryeasily and has been linked with most of the neurological diseases since oxidativestress and mitochondrial dysfunction cause neurodegeneration.First of all, get rid of aluminum pots and pans since this can add aluminum inyour food up to 2mg.The second problem is aluminum based food additives found usually in bakingsoda that does not clarify that is aluminum free and some cheeses(*) (always buydairy products from small local farmers).(*)Cheese in a serving of frozen pizzas had up to 14 mg of aluminum!Aluminum can also be found in cosmetic products such as deodorants andtoothpastes, but fortunately we now have many natural alternatives for these.For reducing blood aluminum levels the most important things to consume are:1)Zinc (oysters)2)Vitamin C3) Thiamine4)Vitamin B6 (try to stay away from synthetic vitamin B6 since it will harm yourliver)ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",357
Page 201,"5)Copper from beef liver in order to supplement NAC for a short period of timewhich will deplete copper levelsand the most important of all when it comes to aluminum is 6)Magnesiummalatewhich has the ability to bind aluminum andremove it from the body.Heavy metal number 4: MercuryMercury is yet another heavy metal that crosses the blood brain barrier and it hasbeen linked with many mental problems.Mercury is a naturally occuring, toxic heavy metal.There are two types of mercury we need to pay attention to since all the otherones have been discontinued from the products that were used in.Number 1 is organic mercury/methylmercury.Methylmercury is a powerful neurotoxin and people exposed to high levels willexperience adverse health effects.Exposure to methylmercury most commonly occurs when people eat kinds of fishand shellfish that have high levels of methylmercury in their tissues.The things to avoid are big fish such as tuna, swordfish, do not buy salmon if youcan not afford a wild caught voodoo one since it is one of the dirtiest foods youcan get your hands one (farmed salmon eat their own feces) and stick to smallfish.(Selenium is the most effective dietary compound against methylmercury).Number 2 is elemental (metallic) mercury.Exposures to metallic mercury most often occur when metallic mercury is spilled,or when products that contain metallic mercury break, so that mercury is exposedto the air.If your dentist tells you that silver/mercury amalgams are safe, get a new dentist.Now if you already have silver amalgams already, a dentist could replace themquite easily and safely.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",365
Page 202,"Heavy metal number 5: ArsenicArsenic is known to cause an increase in lung, bladder and skin cancers.Arsenic is a metalloid, meaning it can exhibit some properties both of metals andnon-metals which finds its way into air, food, soil and groundwater.Exposure to arsenic happens through unfiltered water, some seafood and ricebased products.Sprouted white rice is a health food if cooked in bone broth and should not beeliminated.What you should do instead is avoid rice products made out of big foodcompanies and always soak rice overnight, draining it and rinsing it before youcook it.This opens up the grain and allows arsenic to be washed out.The most effective tool against arsenic are pectins which we will discuss soon.Heavy metal number 6: Iron.The biggest heavy metal issue we face today is unbound iron.Most people today consume way too many PUFAs and their iron homeostasis isfar from optimal.This results in a lot of oxidative stress and thus metabolic problems.Copper and vitamin C are the main regulators of iron homeostasis.If you are not a child you need very little iron to maintain health and obviously notthe kind of raw metal shavings which are added to iron fortified foods such ascommon wheat.Unbound iron can destroy your entire metabolism (and thus cause cancer,Alzheimer’s and many other diseases) like nothing else.Iron is highly unstable unless properly bound and buffered by some specificproteins such as lactoferrin.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",334
Page 203,"To put it simply the problem is not iron itself exactly but when it's present in itsfree form because due to its ability to participate in redox reactions, iron is acatalyst for the formation of hydroxyl radicals from reduced forms of O2.Reducing excess iron will help someone with all sorts of niche health areas suchas heal cancer, hair-loss, acne, eczema, insomnia, ED, chronic fatigue and so on.Unbound iron contributes to illnesses through the promotion of bacteria andviruses which need iron in order to replicate.This alters our microbiota and feeds pathogenic species of bacteria which excretetoxic compounds that destroy our internal organs.Surprisingly, one of the most common causes of bloating when consuming grainsis not gluten (which i am not a fun of in hybridized grains but more about this inlesson 2), but the iron that they fortify the cereals with.This form of iron causes an immediate increase in bacteria and their excretoryproducts then harm the digestive tract, causing spasms, bloating, and diarrhea orconstipation.But what about anemia?Doesn’t an anemic person need to consume more iron?The short answer is no.Anemia in 99% of the cases is not actually caused by a lack of iron in the diet buta deficit of the vitamins and nutrients which are involved in the metabolism of ironwith the most common ones being vitamin A, vitamin D, biotin and vitamin Cwhich is required to keep iron in a biologically soluble state.What can we do about unbound iron?ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",336
Page 204,"First of all be patient since regulating iron homeostasis can take up to a year andthis illustrates that iron homeostasis is not something to be taken lightly.Step 1: Stop consuming iron fortified foods (avoid all grains) and stop consumingfoods extremely high in iron for 3 months.Step 2: Get on a very small dose of a natural antibiotic such as oregano oil sinceantibiotics bind to iron preventing it being used by bacteria.This will also help you with any candida overgrowth you might be facing (Nowfood’s candida support is a surprisingly good supplement also).Ideally you want to consume 3-5 days(not on back to back days) of the antibioticper week for 2-3 weeks in total followed by 2-3 weeks of a probiotic/colostrum.If the antibiotic somewhat dysregulates your gut and causes “some” stress(without any pain obviously), it’s a sign that yes, in fact you were struggling withsome candida overgrowth.Step 3: start adding in your diet the following foods: pineapple, carrots, squash,pumpkin and garlic/onions/broccoli since sulfur strongly binds to excess iron andfoods high in manganese every once in a while such as maple syrup.Step 4: start adding turmeric and black pepper to your meat once in a while.Step 5: consider supplementing with 200-500mg of vitamin C and 50-100mg ofthiamine for up to 4 weeks since both of these is crucial for iron regulation and theexcretion of any extra iron through the skin and urine (if you have too muchunbound iron and supplement thiamine, you might find that you smell bad afterabout 45-90 minutes of consuming it). Vitamin C will help remove iron that isstored in the tissues and prevent it from oxidizing.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",399
Page 205,"Step 6: the weekly oysters with some turmeric and black pepper, should take careof any zinc deficiency that might be present and cause an iron excess whilepreventing iron absorption from oysters.Step 7: consider supplementing with brewer’s yeast since riboflavin (B2) canprevent pathogenic bacteria from using iron.Step 8: Biweekly beef liver since vitamin A stimulates the release of iron that isstored in the tissues.Step 9: No alcohol for 4-12 weeks since alcohol stimulates the increased uptakeof iron by tissues.The absorption of iron is also stimulated when stress hormones are elevated andthus the diet plan that was presented in chapter 1.2 about thyroid with theaddition of one more type of organ meat such as beef kidney or heart once aweek, is ideal for optimizing iron homeostasis since it has plenty of copper in it aswell and the replacement of copper by iron in someone’s diet will dramaticallyincrease estrogen.At this stage, older women can benefit from careful progesterone or evenprogesterone supplementation as well for this reason.How to detox from heavy metals the safe way.The safest and extremely efficient way to detox from heavy metals after makingsure that the nutrient needs are covered, is binders.Binders latch onto heavy metals and refuse to let them go until they reach thebody’s exit door aka the bathroom.Without a binder, heavy metals (and other endotoxins) are quickly reabsorbedinto the bloodstream.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",325
Page 206,"Binder #1 Activated charcoal (AC)Activated charcoal is made by heating carbon rich material such as wood, peat orcoconut shells to a very high temperature and the AC then becomes a fine blackpowder which when consumed will bind to tons of endotoxins (from heavy metals,to xenoestrogens, to parasites) because it carries slight negative electricalcharge which acts like a magnet for the positively charged toxins.AC is so effective for being a binder that emergency rooms use it to treatoverdoses.BUT, if taken for over a few weeks it will bind into important minerals andantioxidants so it should be treated very carefully and when someone chooses toconsume it he should also supplement with magnesium, drink raw milk, eat seasalt and not skip on oysters or organ meats.Binder #2 Bentonite clayBentonite clay has been used for centuries to pull out toxins from the body.But we will not get deep into this tool since a) it can be very dangerous and b)most people do not need it.Binder #3 ChlorellaChlorella is a genus of single celled green algae belonging to the divisionChlorophyta and it likes to bind mercury and lead in the gut.When it comes to chlorella we are talking about chlorella pyrenoidosa.Binding tool #4: PectinsPectin is a naturally occurring substance found in berries, apples and other fruit.There are two types of pectin that are recommended:First: citrus pectinSecond apple pectinBinding tool #5 IMD (Intestinal metal detox)IMD is highly purified silica(*) with covalently bonded elements.IMD binds to heavy metals such as mercury in the gut and comes in a powderedform.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",384

Page 210,"Plastic also contains phthalates which areassociated with increasedprenatalmortality, reduced growth and birth weight.Some plastic products also contain benzophenones but these are a bigger threatin personal care products since they come in direct contact with our skin.Note: some product’s labels might say “BPA free” but most of them include BPSwhich you should also avoid. Just say no to plastic as much as possible. It’s goodfor the environment too.No “fragrances”.The chemicals used in order to make “fragrances” are classified as allergens ,hormone disruptors , asthma triggers , neurotoxins , carcinogens and they alsocontain phthalates, which are a serious endocrine disruption. Fragrancesfrequently cause allergies, dermatitis, respiratory distress and reproductiveproblems.No triclosan.Triclosan is also an endocrine disruptor which the FDA has banned from soapsbut not toothpastes and has shown to decrease some thyroid hormones.No parabens.Parabens are the mother of all xenoestrogens since they are absorbed so quicklyby your skin. Parabens are associated with increased risk of breast cancer andthey can be found in makeup, body washes, deodorants, shampoos and facialcleansers. So you basically need to get rid of all the toxic feeled shampoos ,moisturizers , sunscreens , fragrances, toothpastes, shaving creams andcleaning products.No PFAS/PFCSⒸHelios_Movement LLC",348
Page 211,"PFAS are used to create non-stick surfaces mostly and are toxic and whenheated they release perfluorooctanoic acid which is linked to thyroid disease,infertility, and a lot of reproductive problems.The US EPA has aruled perfluorinated compounds PFCs as ""likely carcinogens.PFCs are used to create heat-resistant and non-stick coatings as well.Here are some natural alternatives to all of these.-Mineral based sunscreens and deodorants.-Olive oil soap.-Aloe vera.-Coconut oil (from sunscreen, to mouthwash).-For a quick toothpaste recipe try mixing (aluminum free) baking soda, sea saltand coconut oil.-ACV for cleaning.-Natural peppermint spray.-Glass “tupperware”.-Old school skillets and wood cutting boards.-Stick to clothes made out of cotton and merino wool (this one is important).The clothes we wear matter for our health more than we might want to think sinceour entire body is in direct contact with them.Polyester for example increase miscarriages in women and reduces male fertilityat a scary rate.Also many people nowadays have developed acne all over their body due topolyester (especially if they wear polyester at the gym).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",280
Page 212,"Say no to soy fast fashion brands a)for your own health and b) since theymistreat underaged workers.Last but definitely not least…..NO TAP WATER!Most of our bodies contain water. Water is a carrier, well the problem is what itcarries.Besides atrazine, a powerful endocrine disruptor that makes the frogs gay, hereare 12 common dangerous substances that can be found in tap water.Number 1: ChlorineChlorine is commonly added to tap water. The problem with chlorine is that it getsabsorbed very quickly through your skin and that’s the reason why we mention itas the number 1. Because if you’re a regular human being when you think abouttap water you probably think about the water you drink but not the water youshower in. Your skin is a sponge and absorbs anything you put on it. Chlorine isone of the reasons that people who regularly swim in pools face health issuessuch as thyroid issues.A few years ago, filtering my showering water would seem absurd, but this smallhabit has significantly improved my health even though i was not struggling withserious health issues.When chlorine enters the body (either by you drinking tap water or showeringwith it) it produces corrosive acids. This leads to a slow destruction of the glandsthat “hydrate” your organs (your skin is an organ by the way and if you’resuffering from dry skin you should start filtering your water).Number 2: ArsenicAnother reason to filter your showering water is arsenic. Obviously arsenic is avery dangerous compound and you should do your best to avoid it. Consumingeven small doses of it can lead to nerve paralysis and blindness.Arsenic canⒸHelios_Movement LLC",376
Page 213,"also cause lung and skin cancers and may cause other cancers (the associationbetween chronic arsenic exposure and cancer is strongest for skin, lung, andbladder cancer).Arsenic is also one of the reasons that it’s better to stick to oysters and wildcaught fish for your seafood source since the highest levels of arsenic (in allforms) in foods can be found in non wild caught seafood.Number 3: Sodium fluorideI’m not against fluoride but sodium fluoride which is a powerful calcium chelator.Sodium fluoride was first added to the water in order to prevent cavities which isabsurd. If they wanted to prevent cavities they might as well have added zincpicolinate.Sodium fluoride weakens the bones and makes them more prone to fractures.It can also trigger tumors as well as aiding their growth and spread. Today we’reexposed to levels of sodium fluoride so high that lead to iodine displacementwhich is probably one of the reasons that 67/75 studies found reduced IQ inhumans after fluoride exposure since iodine deficiency can lead to a decrease of15 IQ points.Also, the sodium fluoride levels in your drinking water are twice as important forthyroiditis as your family history is.Iodine deficiency by the way is easy to fix and no you should not supplement withiodine or eat “iodine infused” salt.First start by throwing away your toxic toothpaste and switching to a natural one(you can try organic coconut oil as a mouthwash), filtering your drinking andshowering water, then make sure you have enough magnesium and selenium inyour system since without a sufficient amount of these cofactors iodine can getpretty toxic.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",359
Page 214,"Good sources of magnesium are supplements (most magnesium supplementsthat do not contain artificial sweeteners are surprisingly good), spinach cooked ingrass fed butter and organic cacao after you’ve fixed any possible gut issues andtake a break from high oxalate foods.Also make sure to eat oysters and beef liver (not on the same day) once a weeksince magnesium can mess up with your zinc levels if they are not in propellevels and last but not least, eat a very VERY small pinch of organic kelp everyother day for a month and then only 1-2 times a week.You should also make sure that you have enough vitamin C in your system that’scoming from things such as berries. Just do not eat foods high in vitamin C withfoods that are high in iron. Separate these two in a 2+ hour window.Now if you don’t struggle with an iodine deficiency but an iodine excess, seleniumcan cure iodine excess pretty fast.Also boron will displace fluoride from the glands so you may want to do a shortterm (just 2-4 weeks and that’s it) supplementation with it as well.Number 4: Heavy metalsExamples of heavy metals that can be found in tap water and are worthmentioning are : mercury, lead and aluminum.You are probably familiar with the dangers of lead and mercury such as kidneyfailure and low IQ in children, but one thing that’s overlooked a lot of times isaluminum.Aluminum is pretty dangerous and can increase the risk of : Parkinson’s, braindeformities, dementia and Alzheimer’s at a pretty severe level.Heavy metals, despite what studies say, are commonly leaked into tap water andseafood. This is one of the reasons many people have benefited from zeolitesand ALA. (Be careful with both of them as we said).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",405
Page 215,"Number 5: Herbicides and pesticidesIf these things keep away and sometimes kill insects and plants, it’s fairly safe tosay that they can cause damage to our health also.These things destroy our soil, health, cause allergies, lower testosterone andbladder cancer.Various studies have demonstrated a higher risk of prostate cancer in agriculturalpopulations than in the general population, especially the ones exposed tochlordecone (organochlorine pesticide).If you have a wife and she’s breastfeeding, please do your best to avoidpesticides and herbicides in the house (by filtering your drinking and showeringwater, avoiding wheat and rice, peeling the peel off your fruits and sticking toorganic greens) since a significant amount gets passed through breastmilk. And ifthe first food you give to a kid is poisoned, his health might not turn out as goodas it could.Number 6: Antidepressants, birth control and other medicationsIf you’re not filtering your drinking water you’re basically on meds. Every kind ofpharmaceutical drug gets leaked in water sources.One common pharmaceutical that’s being leaked in water sources is birth controlpills.A five year usage of birth control pills doubles the chances of cervical cancer,increases breast cancer, massively lowers fertility, shrinks ovaries and increasesthe chance of birth defects in children.Also even though it is not exactly a med diethyl phthalate is a colorless liquidtypically used to make flexible plastics which can sneak into groundwater fromlandfill leaks and drinking tap water contaminated with diethyl phthalate can lowersperm quality and count, disrupt sex hormone levels, and alter genitaldevelopments.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",362
Page 216,"We don’t need to mention the side effects of consuming polluted antidepressantsand benzodiazepines.Number 7: NitratesNitrates severely damage your health and you should try your best to avoid themif your health is not where you want it to be.Nitrates among other things are the reason why you should also not consumeprocessed meat since they’re loaded with them.Nitrates can affect how the blood carries oxygen and can turn hemoglobin (theprotein in blood that carries oxygen) into methemoglobin.High levels of it can turn skin to a bluish or gray color and cause more serioushealth effects like weakness, excess heart rate, fatigue, and dizziness.Number 8: RadonRadon is the number one cause of lung cancer among non-smokers, accordingto EPA estimates. Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer and isresponsible for about 21,000 lung cancer deaths every year. Radon is aradioactive gas that occurs naturally when the uranium in soil and rock breaksdown. It is invisible, odorless and tasteless.If your tap water has radon, you may be at risk of stomach cancer or internalorgan cancers.Number 9: E coli O157:H7E. coli, is a member of a group of organisms known as coliforms: commonbacteria found in the digestive system of humans and animals. This organism isusually not a cause for concern, as there are only a few strains that causeserious disease in humans. One of these strains is responsible for causingTraveler's diarrhea, and the second is E. coli O157:H7, which contaminates meatand leafy vegetables.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",358
Page 217,"This strain (O157:H7) can cause serious hemorrhagic diarrhea and can havelong term, if not fatal, complications. Unfortunately the tap water in a lot of placescan contain E coli O157:H7.Number 10: PhosphatesThese are compounds of phosphate ions commonly present in fertilizers as plantnutrients and in detergents as a water softener. The presence of phosphates inwater promotes excessive algae growth that makes the water dirty when algaedie.Phosphates enter water systems when dissolved rocks mix into groundwater.High levels of phosphates in the body can put people at high risk of hardenedarterial walls.Number 11: DioxinsDioxins are toxic chemicals not produced or commercially used in the country.They are contaminants produced in combustion processes, like cigarette smokingand forest fire, and discharges from chemical factories.When released in the environment, these chemicals linger around so that we canbreathe them in the air or drink them from tap water. Excess amounts of dioxinscan cause reproductive difficulties and increase the risk of developing cancerwhen consumed in tap water for a long period.Number 12: Nearby chemical plants can contaminate your waterIf you live near chemical plants, refineries, or other industries, chemicals cancontaminate drinking water. According to the Center for Public Integrity,manufacturing plants, mining and waste disposal companies have beencontaminating the water supply across the country for decades. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",310
Page 218,"A 2013 study by the National Research Council found that there were over126,000 plants throughout the country that tested positive for groundwaterpollution.So, if you don’t filter your drinking water, every morning you're basically drinkingheavy metals, fluoride, pesticides, herbicides, antidepressants, birth control pills,antibiotics and a trillion other poisons. No wonder why people are sick.Invest in a reverse osmosis filter or get any kind of filter if you can’t afford areverse osmosis. It will have a positive impact on your health and the way youfeel.Xenoestrogen detox1. Avoid as many sources of xenoestrogen as you can and switch to replacethem with natural alternatives.From plastic bottles, PUFAs and teflon pans all the way to tap water.2. Sweat in the sauna 2-3 times a week in order to detox from endocrinedisruptors like phthalates and BPA.3. Try to incorporate some mild natural aromatase inhibitors in your dietsuch as:-Citrus fruits (or anything that contains naringenin)-Chamomile-Olive oil (and olives)-Palm kernel oil-Mushrooms4. Get enough beta carotene and vitamin A from whole foods such as pumpkin,carrots and beef liver since retinol can aid in bisphenol-A detoxification. Carrotswill also help bind excess estrogens in the gut preventing their reabsorption.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",325
Page 219,"5. 250 mg of vitamin C almost daily for a month.6. Increase your fiber intake from sources such as raw carrots in between mealssince excess xenoestrogen binds to fiber and it is eliminated through bowels.7. Don’t forget that you can support liver detoxification either with ALA (personalfavorite) or NAC for a short period of time to support glutathione (an antioxidantfound in the liver and responsible for detoxification but also thyroid hormoneconversion).A trick to make the effects of these 2 way more powerful is to consume ALA orNAC with bone broth since glutathione is dependent on glycine, cysteine, andglutamine.Do not ignore the phrase “short period of time” since our body is able recycleglutathione pretty well.What does “short term” mean exactly?Anything from supplementing ALA or NAC 2 times a week for 3-4 weeks in total,to 4-5 times a week for 2-3 weeks in total.Obviously you can support your liver detoxification with foods high in sulfur suchas onion and garlic.Don’t skip the free range egg yolks and quality meats also since B vitamins andcholine are crucial for your liver’s detoxification processes.8. Activated charcoal (and the other binders that were mentioned on the heavymetal detox) that binds to xenoestrogens and dead bacteria besides endotoxins.Do not take more than 1-3 grams.9. BoronBoron is a trace mineral which will displace fluoride from the glands and lowercalcification of the soft tissue.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",359
Page 220,"6mg per day seems to be the ideal number for supplementing for up to 4 weeksand from there on prunes and raisins seem to provide enough amounts.10. Provide the right nutrients that will help your liver detoxify xenoestrogens. This is a two part process that happens in the liver.In order to support the first part, you will need to optimize glutathione asdemonstrated on the thyroid health chapter, provide enough B vitamins throughan animal based diet (see lesson 2) and brewer’s yeast, keep the beta caroteneat high doses and perhaps supplement with milk thistle as well.In order to support the second part, you will need bone marrow for glutamine,eggs for choline, magnesium glycinate, vitamin C rich foods and perhaps taurinesupplementation.The total cost by the way of most of the supplements that were mentioned herefor 2-3 months will vary from 60-150$ depending on where you live.11. Last reminder to not skip on vitamin E rich foods.Many of the side effects of estrogen can be offset by vitamin E but estrogenincreases the body’s needs for vitamin E as well.This is the end for lesson 1.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",266

Page 231,"So the question is which diet will provide us with the right building blocks and insufficient amounts, and lesson 2 answers exactly that with the bonus that is alsofocused on optimizing one’s testosterone levels since from 1987 the average manin 2021 has 40.8% LESS testosterone.This drop is very dangerous since we are talking about levels less than 500ng/dlwhich lead to depression, anxiety, insomnia, chronic fatigue, man boobs, thyroidproblems, being unmotivated, ED, emotional instability and a huge list of bothphysical and mental problems.So we will both cover the basics of a proper human diet but also add keycomponents that will help you get your testosterone and androgen levels at thetop % of men.But in order to nourish your body like a king you need to optimize gut health first.You can consume the most nutritious foods on the planet but if your gut can notabsorb any of the nutrients, it won’t matter.Everything starts from and depends on the gut.Our gut health affects every biological process that happens inside our bodiesand so, if our gut health becomes dysregulated and suboptimal, every biologicalprocess becomes dysregulated and suboptimal.So focusing on the gut health lesson you saw in lesson 1 will be critical.Now, ee can break a diet down into two parts.Part 1: MacronutrientsMacro means large, so macronutrients are the nutrients that your body needs inlarge amounts (many grams).There are three macronutrients:1)Carbohydrates2)Protein3)FatⒸHelios_Movement LLC",337
Page 232,"Each macronutrient is measured in grams, but the calories per gram of eachmacronutrient isn't the same.Protein and carbohydrates have 4 calories for every gram.Fat has 9 calories for every gram.Every single macronutrient is important.When someone is deficient insaturatedfats for example,his cells break downand function poorly. Cells need saturated fats, not only for fuel but also forstructural components and to participate in metabolic pathways. We need qualityfood sources of fat because fat is a carrier of the important fat soluble vitaminsA,D,E and K. Without the proper absorption of these vitamins, our health willbegin to deteriorate since they are important for many functions of the body suchas the function of the thyroid and the iron homeostasis.Each of the fat soluble vitamins has an estrogen lowering and thus testosteroneenhancing effect.Saturated fats are a critical substance for optimal testosterone production, as weneed them in order to begin producing testosterone in the first place (see lesson1 Leydig cell).When we are talking about fats, we are not talking about high inflammatory fatsand unstable when exposed to heat such as vegetable oils but saturated fatswhich are anti-inflammatory, stable when exposed to heat, lower endotoxins andsupport steroid hormone production.Avoid unsaturated fats and consume saturated fats in order for your cells to beable to rebuild properly.

There are three main types of carbohydrates:1)Starches2)Fiber3)SugarsWe mostly like fructose, some specific types of fiber and very very few types ofstarch since they are the most pro metabolic.Carbohydrates are our body's main source of energy: They help fuel our brain,kidneys, heart muscles, and central nervous system.Carbs are broken down by the body into glucose whichis used as fuel by yourbody’s cells, tissues, and organs. Glucose is also extremely important for thebrain, which can’t easily use other fuel sources like fat or protein for energy.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",194
Page 235,"A carbohydrate-deficient diet may cause headaches, fatigue, weakness, difficultyconcentrating, nausea, thyroid issues, metabolic issues, hormonal issues (eventhough the last three are kind of one and the same), vitamin and mineraldeficiencies which is one of the reasons people who take part in keto andcarnivore diets for years have tremendously aged skin and decreased skinelasticity.Carbs are probably the best macronutrient that can be pseudo characterized asan “antioxidant” since fats and protein produce less CO2 which acts as apowerful antioxidant than carbs.Some cells in the body can only run on carbs.So carbsare the preferred fuel ofthe body and without them it will raise stress hormones and thus metabolicproblems.Last but not least, fructose, which will be mentioned in the micronutrient densefoods, has been proven to lower SHBG levels and allow for more freetestosterone in the bloodstream.Quality carb sources are:1)Raw honey2)Raw dairy3)Any seasonal and organic fruit4)Berries5)Kiwis6)Orange and grapefruit juice with no pulp7)Sprouted rice cooked in bone broth8)Extremely ripe bananas and mangos9)Some sweet potatoes10)Pumpkin11)Squash12)Some sprouted spelt bread once in a whileⒸHelios_Movement LLC",295

Proteins also regulate the body’s processes that help itmaintain fluid balance. Albumin and globulin for example are proteins in our blood that help maintain ourbody’s fluid balance by attracting and retaining water.You need to provide your body with quality animal protein since it is constantlybreaking it down during the day and in order to produce pro metabolic hormones.Protein also is also the most thermogenic (“converts better to heat”) of the threemacronutrients and needed for the stimulation of stomach acid and promoteoptimal digestion.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",244
Page 237,"A chronic protein deficient diet is very dangerous and will lead to the breakdownof your body.Having experimented with myself and clients over the years besides readingpapers, the ideal amount of protein somone could consume every day, is 2-2.5grams per kg of bodyweight.If you go over this sooner or later you will face problems with amonia most likely,and if you go lower than this stress hormones will rise.Note 1: When we are referring to protein we are referring to sources that have ahigh protein bioavailability aka animal products which are rich in crucial vitamins,minerals and aminos that plants are not.Things such as zinc, copper, carnitine, vitamin A, choline, B vitamins, CLA andcreatine that animal products are rich in, are all crucial for a healthy body.Plants have their (crucial) place in someone's diet, but a) the right plants andb)prepared the right way.Note 2: When it comes to protein we need the proper ratio of the aminos such astyrosine, glycine, taurine, proline, alanine, and tyrosine with the aminos such asmethionine, cysteine and tryptophan. In order for this to happen stick toproteinsources such as:1)Free range grass-finished meats if possible2)Free range organic eggs3)Raw dairy4)Bone marrow5)Low heavy metal seafood6)Organ meats7)Lamb8)Some grounded muscle meats once in a while with bone broth rice on the side9)Some shrimp10)OystersSo here’s a simple reminder in the form of a food pyramid.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",365
Page 238,"Now, each one of these nutrients has a different digestion and absorption time.For example, fats can take up to 3 times more time to be digested than carbs.So typically, a pre workout meal if you are interested in performance, shouldprimarily include carbs and protein.A ratio of 50% carbs, 30-40% protein and 10-20% fat, seems to be ideal for a preworkout meal.When it comes to macronutrient ratios, a thing that many unfortunately dismiss asa “bro myth” but will actually help many people that are familiar withmacronutrient ratios is eating based on your somatotype (metabolic typing).There are three somatotypes (which are obviously not a bro myth).1) EctomorphEctomorphs are thin, small boned and usually they can not gain weight easily.This somatotype should be more carb based macronutrient wise.The ideal macronutrient ratio seems to be: 40-50% carbs, 30-40% protein and20% fat.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",232

They can put on fat as easily as they put on muscle but it’s almost impossiblefor them to get lean.Endomorphs a lot of times get mistaken as such due to metabolic damage andthyroid issues. So before you characterize yourself as an endomorph apply whatyou read on chapter 1 for at least 12 weeks.If you’re an endomorph, the best macronutrient ratio seems to be: 40-50%protein, 20-30% carbs and 20-30% fat.3) MesomorphMesomorphs have medium size bone structure and can put on weight fairly easilyif they focus on a decent caloric surplus such as 400-500calories. These peopleare natural muscle gainers and can see progress with almost any type ofprogram. It’s not uncommon for these people to put on muscle on basicbodyweight splits.The ideal macronutrient ratio for this type seems to be: 30-40% carbs, 30-40%protein and 20-30% fat.Jack of all trades macronutrient split.Having experimented with many macronutrient ratios, the majority of people wholive busy lives but also want to have good and intense training sessions, respondbest to a 40% protein, 30% carbs and 30% fats breakfast and lunch, a 40-50%carbs, 30% protein and 20-30% fats for dinner and as we said a 50% carbs,30-40% protein and 10-20% fat pre and post workout meals.This would be a good place to start if you are a beginner and interested inmacronutrient ratios in order to improve your performance.Part 2: MicronutrientsMicronutrients are vitamins and minerals needed by the body in very smallamounts (mg and μg) . However a deficiency in any of them can cause severeⒸHelios_Movement LLC",416
Page 240,"health problems since they perform a range of functions, including enabling thebody to produce enzymes and hormones.Micronutrients > Macronutrients.The fuel you give your body matters. You might be able to give it crap for fuel fora few months but sooner or later it will catch up to you.A calorie is not a calorie. Nutrition matters. It’s not a coincidence that the mostfilling foods are also the most nutritious foods. Try getting full by eating potatochips…… ain’t happening. You can eat 2000kcal of chips and not get full at allbecause there’s zero nutrition in there. On the other hand , try not getting full byeating 2000kcal of meat and fruits. You will get full.Some say that you’re getting full because of the volume of food you consume.Not the case.Try having 2000 kcal of rice cakes , yeah you’ll get full…..for 30 minutes.Your body is not dump , if you provide it with proper fuel , you’ll be able to cross along distance and if you don't , you'll be able to cross only a short distance.There are 25 key vitamins and minerals. So let’s see which ones are they andwhere we should get them from.2.12 The 25 key vitamins, minerals and their bioavailable sourcesFirst of all, vitamins are organic substances that are generally classified as eitherfat soluble or water soluble.Fat soluble vitamins such as: vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and vitamin Kdissolve in fat and tend to accumulate in the body. They also need to beconsumed with a meal that has saturated fats (ex coconut oil, EVOO) in order tobe absorbed properly.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",371
Page 241,"Water soluble vitamins such as: vitamin C and the B-complex vitamins mustdissolve in water before they can be absorbed by the body, and therefore cannotbe stored.Any water-soluble vitamins unused by the body are primarily lost through urine.Minerals are inorganic elements present in soil and water, which are absorbed byplants or consumed by animals and include things such as: calcium, magnesium,potassium, zinc, copper and iodine.Now let’s see these vitamins and minerals one by one.1)Vitamin A (Retinol) Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient meaning that our bodies cannotmanufacture it and therefore it has to be included in our diet.Vitamin A from food is stored in the liver until required by the body and isessential for many physiological processes, including maintaining the integrityand function of all surface tissues such as the skin, the lining of the respiratorytract, the gut, the bladder, the inner ear and the eye.Vitamin A supports the daily replacement of skin cells and ensures that tissuessuch as the conjunctiva are able to produce mucus and provide a barrier toinfection.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",253
Page 242,"Vitamin A is also essential for vision under conditions of poor lighting, formaintaining a healthy immune system, for growth and development and forreproduction.The best sources of vitamin A (retinol) are:1)Beef, duck, chicken, lamb and turkey liver2)Organs3)Raw cheese4)Egg yolks5)Grass fed butter and ghee6)ClamsVitamin A should not be supplemented due to its toxicity and the classicsymptoms that someone might experience a deficiency in vitamin A areextremely dry skin (vitamin C, E and K2 also play an important role on this one)and eyes and loss of night vision.2)Vitamin B1 (Thiamine) Thiamine helps the body's cells change carbohydrates into energy as we saw inlesson 1.Thiamine also plays a role in muscle contraction and conduction of nerve signalsand is essential for the metabolism of pyruvate.Thiamine helps prevent complications in the nervous system, brain, muscles,heart, stomach, intestines and is also involved in the flow of electrolytes into andout of muscle and nerve cells.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",253
Page 243,"The best food sources of vitamin B1 sources:1)Brewer’s yeast2)Organic pork cooked in some coconut oil3)Sprouted rice cooked in bone broth4)Spirulina5)Some organic coffee6)OrgansThiamine can also be supplemented and most of the thiamine supplements are ofdecent quality.The basic rules for thiamine supplementation is to always supplement it with ameal that has some carbohydrates, avoid supplementing thiamine for more than4-6 weeks straight and it is best to consume thiamine up until 4 P.M in order forsomeone not to face any sleeping problems.But thiamine will always be a better option for an energy boost than coffee later inthe day.The typical signs of not only a thiamine but a B vitamin deficiency in general arechronic fatigue and symptoms of neurological diseases such as memory loss buteven under performing mentally and ADD like symptoms. ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",208
Page 244,"3)Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) Riboflavin is important for body growth, it helps in red blood cell production andaids in the release of energy from proteins.Riboflavin is crucial for converting tryptophan to niacin, helping the adrenalsproduce hormones and maintaining the mucous membranes in the digestivesystem.We need to consume vitamin B2 daily, because the body can only store smallamounts and its supplies go down rapidly.The best food sources of vitamin B2 are:1)Spirulina2)Beef3)Brewer’s yeast4)Raw dairy5)Mushrooms6)Egg yolks7)AvocadosMost B2 supplements should be avoided except spirulina and brewer's yeastsupplements which are extremely effective for replenishing B2 levels andrelatively safe.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",197
Page 245,"4)Vitamin B3 (Niacin) Niacin is one of the eight B vitamins, and it’s also called vitamin B3.There are two main chemical forms of niacin:1)Nicotinic acid2)Niacinamide (sometimes called nicotinamide)The key role of niacin in our body is to synthesize the coenzymes nicotinamideadenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate(NADP), which are involved in over 400 biochemical reactions in your bodymainly related to obtaining energy from the food we eat (see lesson 1).The best food sources of vitamin B3 are:1)Organic pork cooked in some coconut oil2)Chicken soup3)Turkey with a side of bone broth4)Skirt steak5)MushroomsAs we saw, vitamin B3 can be supplemented but only if a few key componentsare in check first as we saw in lesson 1.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",220
Page 246,"5)Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid) Vitamin B5, also called pantothenic acid, is necessary for making blood cells andas with all B vitamins it helps us convert the food we eat into energy.Vitamin B5 is needed for:●healthy skin, hair, and eyes●proper functioning of the nervous system and liver●healthy digestive tract●making red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body●making sex and stress-related hormones in the adrenal glandsThe best sources of vitamin B5 are:1)Egg yolks2)Chicken liver3)Beef kidney4)Sprouted rice with mushrooms5)Raw dairySupplementing B5 can be tricky and it's best to be avoided.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",168
Page 247,"6)Vitamin B6 Vitamin B6 or pyridoxine, is a water-soluble vitamin found naturally in manyfoods, as well as added to foods and supplements.Pyridoxal 5’ phosphate (PLP) is the active coenzyme form and most commonmeasure of B6 blood levels in the body.PLP is a coenzyme that assists more than 100 enzymes to perform variousfunctions, including the breakdown of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats;maintaining normal levels of homocysteine (since high levels can cause heartproblems), supporting immune function and brain health.Vitamin B6 plays an important role in mood regulation.This is partly because this vitamin is necessary for creating neurotransmittersincluding serotonin, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).Vitamin B6 may also play a role in decreasing high blood levels of the amino acidhomocysteine, which have been linked to depression and other psychiatricissues.The best sources of vitamin B6 are:-Beef liver (and other organs)-FishⒸHelios_Movement LLC",236
Page 248,"-PoultryVitamin B6 should not be supplemented and avoided in any artificial form (most, ifnot all, energy drinks have an artificial form of vitamin B6).7)Vitamin B7 (Biotin) Biotin improves the texture of the skin by preventing oxidative damage, isessential in improving the cognitive functioning of the brain by repairing the braincells, is extremely important for our vision and is helpful for people suffering fromkidney problems.As with all B vitamins, biotin is a coenzyme for carboxylase enzymes that areinvolved in:●synthesizing, or creating, fatty acids●synthesizing the amino acids isoleucine and valine●gluconeogenesis, or generating glucoseThe best sources of vitamin B7 are:-Beef liver-Egg yolks-Pork (if organic)ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",190
Page 249,"-Salmon roe every once in a whileBiotin can be supplemented if needed relative safely just make sure that youhave enough magnesium, copper and zinc in your system.8)Vitamin B8 (Inositol) Although inositol is referred to as vitamin B8, it is not a vitamin but a sugar thatplays a structural role in the body as a major component of cell membranes andis necessary for blood sugar control.In addition, it affects the regulation of serotonin and dopamine.Inositol has many potential benefits and is usually used for psychological issues(depression, anxiety) and metabolic problems.Now, unless someone is deficient in inositol, the above benefits all spring fromthe improvement of glucose metabolism since a dysregulated glucosemetabolism will lead to issues such as mood swings and panic attacks.The best sources of vitamin B8 are:-Beef-Citrus fruit juices with no pulp such as orange juice or grapefruit juiceⒸHelios_Movement LLC",209
Page 250,"Just make sure to not combine the two.Inositol can be supplemented pretty safely if someone has enough choline in hissystem. So if you are going to take inositol make sure to have some eggs in theday.Note since we are talking about supplements: Do NOT start taking one trillionsupplements to improve your health and check the supplement guide in order tounderstand better how to use supplements.9) Vitamin B9 (folic acid) Vitamin B9 or folic acid is crucial for proper brain function, plays an important rolein mental and emotional health, aids in the production of DNA and RNA, thebody's genetic material, it helps to control blood levels of the amino acidhomocysteine along with B6 and B12, can prevent and even reverse age relatedhearing loss and macular degeneration, can protect the development of manyforms of cancer and the list keeps going and ends with the fact that a B9deficiency can cause birth defects and even miscarriages.The best sources of vitamin B9 are:-Beef liver-Organic asparagus and spinach cooked in grass fed butter or ghee (the cookingin animal fats is crucial in order to lower the antinutrient content).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",265
Page 251,"9)Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 is needed to form red blood cells, DNA and it helps in the functionand development of brain and nerve cells.Vitamin B12 binds to the protein in the foods we eat and the hydrochloric acidand enzymes in the stomach unbind vitamin B12 into its free form by freeing itfrom haptocorrin.From there, vitamin B12 combines with a protein called intrinsic factor so that itcan be absorbed further down in the small intestine.Vitamin B12 also functions as a cofactor for two enzymes, methionine synthaseand L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.Methionine synthase catalyzes the conversion of homocysteine to the essentialamino acid methionine.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",171
Page 252,"Methionine is required for the formation of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl donor(crucial for testosterone as you will see) for almost 100 different substrates,including DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids.The best sources of vitamin B12 are:-Beef liver-Beef-Clams-Sardines-Raw dairy10) Beta carotene Beta carotene is a precursor of vitamin A and like all carotenoids, it is anantioxidant.Many studies have suggested that those who consume at least fourdailyservings of beta carotene rich fruits and/or vegetables have a lower risk ofdeveloping cancer, lung issues, heart disease and experiencing cognitive decline.Also, the most neglected nutrient for thyroid health is probably beta carotene.The best beta carotene sources:1)PumpkinⒸHelios_Movement LLC",194
Page 253,"2)Squash3)Peaches4)Carrots5)Apricots6)Cantaloupe7)Mangos8)Sweet potatoes9)Plums10)Grapefruit juice (no pulp)11) Boron Boron is a trace mineral that helps our bodies metabolize vitamins and minerals,has a key role in bone health and brain health and affects estrogen, SHBG, freeand total testosterone levels.Boron can also extend the half life of vitamin D, help the adrenals, improvemuscle coordination, muscle glycogen, sleep and remove sodium fluoride.The best dietary sources of boron are:-Prunes-Raisins-AvocadosⒸHelios_Movement LLC",156
Page 254,"Just look at the ingredients in prunes and raisins since most of themunfortunately are laced with inderior fats such as sunflower and canola oils.Supplemental boron is even recommended every once in a while these days dueto the amount of sodium fluoride most people have consumed over the years, notenough bioavailable calcium and bad soil health.The typical dose of 3-6 mg is good enough and i do not suggest going higher.12) Vitamin C From protecting our cells against oxidative stress, maintaining healthy skin, bloodvessels, iron homeostasis, heart, improved nitric oxide function, glucosemetabolism, blood volume regulation, bones and cartilage all the way tosteroidogenesis, fighting allergies, reducing cortisol, improving sleep, preventingcognitive decline and supporting the thyroid gland, vitamin C is an extremelyimportant nutrient.The best dietary sources of vitamin C:1)Acerola cherry juice (no pulp)2)Blackberries3)Pomegranate juice (no pulp)4)Kiwis5)Oranges juice (no pulp)6)Grapefruit juice (no pulp)ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",245
Page 255,"7)Strawberries8)Raspberries9)PineappleYou can supplement vitamin C but as we said make sure to consume it with ameal that has sodium in it and wash it down with an acidic beverage preferablesome of the mentioned juices.If you are going to supplement with vitamin C supplement with a dose as low as250 mg and do not increase it if there’s no need for it but always favorpomegranate and acerola cherry juice (no pulp) over synthetic vitamin C.13) Calcium Calcium is a mineral needed for bone and teeth formation, nerve function,regulating heartbeat and helping muscles to contract.About 99% of the body’s calcium is stored in bones and the remaining 1% isfound in blood, muscle, and other tissues.The body gets the calcium it needs in two ways. One is by eating foods thatcontain calcium and the other is by drawing from calcium in the body.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",210
Page 256,"If one does not eat enough calcium-containing foods, the body will removecalcium from bones.Ideally, the calcium that is “borrowed” from the bones will be replaced at a laterpoint.But this doesn’t always happen, and can’t always be accomplished just by eatingmore calcium if vitamin K2 and D levels are not optimal.The best sources of calcium are:-Raw dairy-Bone broth/marrow-Eggshells14) Choline (Vitamin J or B4) Choline plays an important part in many processes in your body, including cellstructure (make fats that support the structural integrity of cell membranes), braindevelopment, cell messaging, fat metabolism (without enough choline cholesterolwill buildup in the liver instead of being used), DNA synthesis, a healthy nervoussystem (choline is required in order for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to beⒸHelios_Movement LLC",200
Page 257,"made which is involved in muscle movement and regulating heartbeat amongother things) and healthy leptin levels.The best sources of choline are:-Egg yolks (any type (chicken, fish and so on)).-Liver-Red meatEven though not necessary, if you ever supplement with choline stick toCDP-choline and alpha-GPC.15) Copper Copper is an essential trace mineral found in higher concentrations in organssuch as theliver, kidneys, brain and heart.The mitochondria depend on copper for energy metabolism and copper plays akey role in functions within the body such as: red blood cell production, ironabsorption, the regulation of heart rate and blood pressure, the development andmaintenance of connective tissue, bones and organs, immune systemmaintenance and activation, brain development, a healthy supply of white bloodcells and takes part in oxygen metabolism.Copperis absorbed partially in the stomach where the highly acidic environment frees theⒸHelios_Movement LLC",210
Page 258,"bound copper ions from partially digested foods. However, the largest portion ofingested copper passes into the duodenum and ileum, which are the major sitesof absorption so a high fraction of copper is soluble in the intestinal tract and inorder for copper to be properly absorbed and utilized one must focus on healinghis gut as well.The best sources of copper are:-Organ meats-Shellfish-Organic cacao16) Vitamin D Vitamin D is technically a hormone and is best created when UV light from thesun hits your skin (it is produced endogenously when ultraviolet (UV) rays fromsunlight strike the skin and trigger vitamin D synthesis).Vitamin D along vitamin K2 are the hidden keys for bone health.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",162
Page 259,"Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption in the gut and maintains adequate serumcalcium and phosphate concentrations to enable normal bone mineralization andto prevent hypocalcemic tetany besides being needed for bone growth and boneremodeling by osteoblasts and osteoclasts.Vitamin D has other roles in the body, including reduction of inflammation as wellas modulation of such processes as cell growth, neuromuscular and immunefunction and glucose metabolism as we saw.Vitamin D plays a key role in preventing autoimmune diseases, muscle waste,reverse steroid driven hair loss, glucose metabolism, steroidogenesis, calciumabsorption.17) Vitamin E Vitamin E is a lipid-soluble component in the cell antioxidant defense system andis exclusively obtained from the diet but vitamin E is heavily dependent on vitaminC, vitamin B3, beta carotene, selenium and glutathione.So applying what you’ve read so far and optimizing glutathione function (lesson1) will be critical in order for the body to be able to utilize vitamin E properly.Vitamin E is one of the most effective antioxidants we have in our disposal andmaking sure to provide enough dietary vitamin E will greatly improve everyaspect of one’s health.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",264
Page 260,"The best sources of vitamin E are:-Palm kernel oil-EVOO-Egg yolks-LiverMost, if not all, vitamin E supplements are toxic and should be avoided.18) Vitamin K Vitamin K refers to agroup (K1 and K2)of fat solublevitamins which are foundthroughout the body including the liver, brain, heart, pancreas and bones andthus protecting each one of these.The first (K1) is called phylloquinone and found in green leafy vegetables likecollard greens, kale, and spinach.The second (K2), menaquinones, are found in some animal and fermented foodssuch as natto.Vitamin K helps to make various proteins that are needed for blood clotting(*) andthe building of bones(**).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",184
Page 261,"(*)Prothrombin for example is a vitamin K-dependent protein directly involved withblood clotting.(**)Osteocalcin is a protein that requires vitamin K to produce healthy bonetissue.The best sources of vitamin K are:-Natto-Raw dairy-Egg yolks-Cheeses-Spinach cooked in animal fatsVitamin K can be supplemented if it is in a liquid form with an EVOO base.19) Manganese Manganese is a trace mineral and is found mostly in bones, the liver, kidneys,and pancreas.It helps the body form connective tissue, bones, blood clotting factors, sexhormones, plays a role in fat and carbohydrate metabolism, calcium absorption,blood sugar regulation, supports fertility, is a component of the antioxidantenzyme superoxide dismutase which helps fight free radicals and is necessaryfor normal brain and nerve function.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",202
Page 262,"But you do not need that much manganese so the weekly oysters and occasionalorganic cacao and maple syrup will take care of any needs.Manganese supplements usually are not recommended due to the fact that mostbrands use toxic fillers.20) Magnesium Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the human body and it’ssomething most people are deficient in.During digestion, three primary digestive enzymes turn food into nutrients thatcan be absorbed and assimilated by the body and magnesium plays a role innumerous enzyme systems throughout the body.Magnesium directs excessive calcium outside the cell, promoting relaxation in thestressed areas.Magnesium also lowers SHBG levels and therefore it can increase freetestosterone.Magnesium assists more than 300 enzymes to carry out various chemicalreactions in the body such as building proteins, strong bones,oxidativephosphorylation, glycolysis, blood pressure, muscle and nerve functions.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",206
Page 263,"Magnesium also acts as an electrical conductor that contracts muscles andmakes the heart beat steadily.More than half of the magnesium in our body is stored in bones, and theremaining in various tissues throughout the body.Magnesium also plays a role in the active transport of calcium and potassiumions across cell membranes.The best sources of magnesium are:-Mineral water-Cacao-Swimming in the clean ocean-Some magnesium supplements that are not filled with artificial sweeteners andtoxic food additives.Just make sure to use different forms since every form of magnesium tends to goto a specific tissue (for example glycinate has a preference for muscle tissue) soit is in fact better to use different chelates as well.Start with magnesium glycinate and perhaps citrate if you are going to use asupplemental form.

Theyare some of the most micronutrient dense foods that exist.They probably are the most micronutrient dense food after raw dairy and thefoods highest in vitamin A.A vitamin that is super important for your metabolism, thyroid and to maintain aproper balance of : magnesium, zinc and copper in the body.The only “bad” thing about organ meats is that since most people today have ahigh enough iron content in their body, they should be consumed with somecarrots, mushrooms or carrots in order to prevent iron overload and also not becombined with foods high on vitamin C.Recommended organ meats are :-Beef liverⒸHelios_Movement LLC",211
Page 272,"-Beef heart-Beef kidney-Chicken liverBut please try to also consume organ meats only from quality animals sinceotherwise yes, the organs of the animals instead of healing you, can poison you.The simplest test for this that exists is that if the organ meats have a strongmetallic taste, do not eat them.3)Seafood and shellfishGreat sources for: vitamin B6 (something a lot of depressed people are deficientin and neglected even though it is crucial for testosterone production), Niacin,B12, Zinc, Copper, Phosphorus, essential fatty acids and some Vitamin E.Recommended seafood and shellfish are:-Sardines-Cod-Shrimp-Oysters4)EggsAn egg has every single nutrient a little chicken needs to be born.

Page 273,"Obviously, eggs are important too because your body needs enough cholesterolin order to produceeveryimportant hormone.5)Brewer’s yeastBrewer’s yeast contains small organisms (microflora) that help maintain theproper functioning of the digestive tract.Brewer’s yeast is a rich source of: Thiamine (B1), Riboflavin (B2) (which a lot ofpeople are deficient in), Folic acid (B9), Biotin (B7), Niacin (B3), Selenium,Potassium, Zinc and Magnesium.6)Raw dairyThere’s a reason raw dairy is illegal and it’s not because the government isconcerned with your health. Raw dairy heals issues you don’t even realize youhad.Any kind of raw dairy you can get your hands on is recommended.7)CollagenCollagen is the most abundant component of the extracellular matrix and is theprotein that determines your skin physiology. Collagen is way more importantthan we might think, especially as we age since collagen decreases.Collagen use can help : tendon injuries, joint pain, gut issues, wrinkle reductionand the improvement of skin hydration.2.13 What else to avoid1) GMOs and hybridized grainsA Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) is something whose genetic material(DNA) has been interfered with in a way that does not occur naturally by matingor natural breeding.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",317
Page 274,"Well, DNA is a complex structure and altering it in any way can create newconsequences and structures in the cell’s composition, as well as its relationshipwith other cells.For example,when potatoes were genetically engineerednot to show bruising(*). A side effect of this engineering was an increase in the potato's aminoadipicacid content. An acid that has been shown to increase the risk of diabetes.(*)The potato still bruises, it's just that the bruises don't show up because themelanin gene has been suppressed.Genetic engineering also alters the nutritional value of foods which resulted in theGE food containing the same amount of calories with significantly less nutrition.Which is obviously not good since “empty” calories basically deplete you ofnutrients and can damage your mitochondria.Americans have been eating GM food for over 20 years and over 80% of theirprocessed food contains GMOs.GMOs are one of the main reasons why every generation is sicker than the lastone. It is very sad today that avoiding GMOs seems almost impossible. GMOs donot harm only our health, but our unborn kids' health and the environment.GMOs in reality are an attempt for big food corporations to take total control ofour food system (with the help of George W. Bush).We have known for decades that GMOs severely damage the immune system inrats. In one study the Russian national academy of sciences reported that morethan half the babies from mother rats fed GM soy died within three weeks, weresmaller (a lot, smaller) and could not reproduce. Also mice that were fed GMtriticale (a grain hybrid) showed enlarged lymph nodes and when goat’s were fedGM soy their milk contained very very small amounts of proteins instead of thetypical numbers (from 3-5 gr per 100ml usually depending on the goat).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",396
Page 275,"Since GMOs were introduced into the food supply the rate of chronic healthconditions among children in the US increased from 12.8% (in 1994) to 26.6% (in2006).(Especially for things like asthma, behavioral and learning problems).Remember the mention we did on glyphosate? The majority of GM crops are“roundup ready” (herbicide resistant) which is glyphosate for the most part, whichdamages the ecosystems and encourages the development of “super weeds”(weeds that are extremely resistant to glyphosate).GMOs are one of the reasons allergies are so common nowadays. GE (geneticengineering) can transfer allergens from one food to another. For example, whena gene from brazil nuts were engineered into soybeans, people allergic to brazilnuts had the same allergy reactions when eating this batch of soy products asthey would when eating brazil nuts. So GE can “transfer” the allergy you have ona specific food to another food that you consider safe.GE can also cause new allergic responses since well, you’re consumingsomething that hasneverexisted and your body doesnot know what to do withit. GM soy for example can develop 27% higher levels of trypsin-inhibitor (anallergen).What can you do to avoid GMOs.#1 Buy local seasonal fruit.#2 Buy organic if you can afford it.#3 Look for Non-GMO seal#4 Avoid crops where GE is extremely common ( corn, soybeans, canola,cottonseed, sugar (cane sugar is typically GMO free though), modern grains,bananas and papayas and unfortunately most dairy (*) since they’relikely to beGMO unless they are labeled as No rBGH, rBST, or artificial hormones).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",388
Page 276,"(*) The term most dairy does not include raw dairy, a few specific types of grassfed cheeses and milk from farms that you know what the animals are fed.Note: These things so far may seem too much if you try to implement them.Hybridised grainsA lot of people today suffer from brain fog which is alleviated for most of themafter cutting out grains and most starch sources.In modern agriculture, grains are probably the number 2 (soy is probably thenumber 1) thing that is sprayed with enormous amounts of herbicides such asglyphosate. A herbicide linked to cancer and which also leads to environmentalcatastrophes by destroying bee populations.Glyphosate was introduced to the marketplace in 1974 but data on its use is onlyavailable since 1990.Monsanto has genetically modified foods so that they are resistant to glyphosate,a herbicide Monsanto sells, resulting in a dramatic increase in the use ofglyphosate. The study points out that research has shown that ""glyphosatedisrupts the ability of animals, including humans, to detoxify xenobiotics.This means that exposure to the chemicals in food and the environment, such asendocrine disrupting chemicals and carcinogens, could be causing levels ofdamage that would not occur if the body were able to detoxify them.Modern grains destroy people’s guts and brains. There is zero doubt about it.99.999% of people who go gluten free experience positive health benefits. Alsomost of the modern grains have been through excessive hybridization which endsup making gluten very very hard to digest compared to pre hybridized grains suchas einkorn for example. That’s the whole problem with gluten. That the glutenthat’s coming from modern wheat has nothing to do with the gluten we’ve beeneating for thousands of years.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",392
Page 277,"Grains are also high in mycotoxins such as ochratoxin anddeoxynivalenol. Theeffects of mycotoxins on human health can be both acute and chronic, provokingproblems such as liver cancer and respiratory problems. Mycotoxins causepesturbation in the gut, particularly in the intestinal epithelial. Most of the reportedeffects of mycotoxins on human health are negative both short term and longterm.Grains are also high in phytic acid which impairs the body's absorption of iron,zinc, and calcium and can contribute to a lot of mineral deficiencies over time.Most people today are already deficient in a lot of important minerals. Glyphosatealso holds on things like manganese, magnesium and minerals in general to thepoint of starving the plant itself. So a) the nutrient content of the plant is low tobegin with and b) the phytic acid lowers your body’s storage of nutrients (unlessthe plant is cooked in animal fats but still it only works in a sufficient level onlywith green leafy greens).Bread has its place in the human diet (after you’ve addressed issues like candidaand SIBO) because of the production of nicotinamide riboside and that’s why Isuggest eating bread from organic einkorn or spelt sprouted flour once in a while(once every 2-3 weeks).2) Food additivesFood additives are chemicals added to foods to keep them fresh or to enhancetheir color, flavor and texture. They can include things like:-Anti-caking agents (they stop ingredients from becoming lumpy).-Antioxidants (they prevent foods from oxidizing/going rancid).-Artificial sweeteners (increase the sweetness).-Emulsifiers (stop fats from clotting together).-Food acids (they maintain the right acid level).-Colors (they enhance/add color).-Humectants (they keep foods moist).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",426
Page 278,"-Flavors and flavor enhancers.-Foaming agents (they maintain uniform aeration of gasses in foods).-Preservatives (they stop microbes from multiplying and spoiling the food).-Thickeners and vegetable gums (they enhance texture and consistency).-Stabilizers and firming agents (they maintain even food dispersion).-Raising agents (they increase the volume of food through the use of gasses).-Bulking agents (they increase the volume of food without major changes to itsavailable energy).And many other things (MSG etc)Some food additives can be safe in moderation but there are big problems withthings like : artificial sweeteners (worse than GMO sugar), preservatives (food issupposed to rot within a few days), colors, thickeners , bulking agents andvegetable gums.The more unnatural a food becomes the more unhealthy it is. Yet the fitnessindustry has brainwashed people into poisoning themselves with this stuffbecause “they’re low in calories and fill you up”.Food additives harm mostly children. For example the artificial colorings “FD&Cyellow no.5 and no.6” cause allergic reactions very often in children and arelinked with hyperactivity. Also unfortunately, parents often feed their kids trashdeli meats which have sodium nitrates in them most of the time which whenheated and combined with one’s stomach acid produces nitrosamines which arelinked with an increase of pancreatic and colorectal cancer. You must also avoidlike the plague in case you have kids foods that include sulfur dioxide, potassiumbisulfite and sodium sulfite. Basically just feed your kids normal food and checkthe labels of your foods since big food corporations add synthetic crap toeverything these days. Even milk.Now artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose , saccharin, stevia etcare destroying our gut (*), our liver (**)and lead to wild food cravings down theⒸHelios_Movement LLC",426
Page 279,"road. They use artificial sweeteners in everything these days even if it has hugeamounts of sugar in it.(*) Artificial sweeteners pass through the human GI tract without being digestedso they come in direct contact with microbes in the colon resulting in makingpreviously healthy gut bacteria to become diseased and invade the gut wall(anyone who has any gut/intestinal issues should stop consuming artificialsweeteners immediately). Artificial sweeteners can also cause glucoseintolerance way faster than GMO sugar a lot of times.And anyone who might struggle with cancer should immediately stop consumingartificial sweeteners since they have been shown to increase the size ofcancerous tumors. Researchers have called aspartame “a multi potentcarcinogenic compound” and have pointed to the many dangers of artificialsweeteners.Artificial sweeteners in some cases can also trigger irritable bowel syndrome andcrohn’s disease in susceptible patients.(**) Studies have shown that increased consumption of artificial sweeteners(especially in soft drinks) leads to lipid (fat) accumulation in the liver, fibrosis, anddegeneration of the liver.3)LegumesSome sprouted legumes have their place in someone’s diet when he is extremelyhealthy. Most of us are not extremely healthy and consuming legumes will lead toa lot of problems from digestive distress to improper absorption of minerals.(Unsprouted) legumes combine the worst characteristics of grains, nuts andvegetables and should be avoided if you have health issues.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",320
Page 280,"“But legumes are high in nutrients” someone may say. Well, you can’t talk aboutnutrients of a food without checking the antinutrients that it contains.Legumes usually contain large amounts of lectins, phytic acid, phytoestrogens,cyanogenic glucosides (which interfere with iodine absorption and metabolism) ,isoflavones , and soluble fiber which in large doses can harm the liver. Legumesalso are high in protease inhibitors.Proteases are enzymes that break down proteins. So Protease Inhibitors aremolecules that stop proteases from doing their job.Also no matter what you do you should avoid canned legumes since they usuallycontain mega doses of BPA.For this reason it is best for most people to take a break from (unsprouted)legumes for 1-2 months before reintroducing sprouted legumes once every 15days.4) Nut “milks”/Dairy “alternatives”Just as calling seed oils, “oils” is wrong, so is calling nut milks, “milks”.These are not milks. Milk comes only from animals.How are nut “milks” even made? Most of them are made by blending up the nutswith water letting them sit for a while and then straining the mixture to remove thesolids and add things like the seed oils we mentioned, artificial colorings andsweeteners.Well the problem with this is that you are basically drinking poison.You are megadosing on antinutrients, herbicides and pesticides.This is the only thing that you are getting out of these nuts by blending them withwater and straining the mixture.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",379
Page 281,"Almonds for example are extremely high in oxalates and a lot of poor kidsdeveloped kidney and bladder problems from drinking almond milk. Even babiesare fed this stuff nowadays.Almond milk also somehow both indirectly and directly destroys bee populationsand contributes to environmental damage. It is best to avoid nut milks since theypoison you without providing anything beneficial.When it comes to meat alternatives, you shouldn’t eat phytoestrogen, glyphosate,GMO, food additive pumped foods that even starving dogs won’t eat (true story)and provide zero nutrition but tons of antinutrients.Beyond meat’s burgers had an endocrine disrupting effect even more than somebirth control pills. Please avoid.2.14 The most neglected aspect in every diet: waterMost of our bodies contain water. Water is a carrier, well the problem is what itcarries.We mentioned 12 commonly found substances that you can find in water inchapter 1.Here will just put a friendly reminder that the water you consume will play a keyrole in shaping your gut microbiota, hydration levels and thus blood volumeregulation, heart and artery health.Always favor spring water and what i recommend clients do is get a water filterand a glass bottle that they will fill up with the addition of some (a pinch) of seasalt.This way you will not have to worry about chemicals that are put in the water orBPA leaking in it if you leave your bottle in the sun.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",317

Page 300,"muscle pain, masculine features appearing in women, and even testicularshrinkage and gynecomastia (breast tissue development) in men.These patients had all gone to the same chiropractor, who prescribed HealthyLife Chemistry vitamins by Purity First to each of them.Now this scenario will be quite unlikely if you stick to what we mention in thisguide, but i’m mentioning this since a lot of people in the health industry treatsupplements as something mandatory instead of tools based on specificcircumstances (what we’re proposing here).There are also safe supplements and unsafe supplements.Here is what you should pay attention to.1. Never, ever, ever,supplement with Vitamin A, betacarotene and B6.Every single one of these vitamins can cause severe liver damage.I made a mistake, i shouldn’t have written it “can” cause, but it “will”cause.So avoid every synthetic form of these vitamins unless your doctor tells youotherwise.This also means to avoid energy drinks which are filled with toxic syntheticvitamins and a lot of them even contain pretty high doses of them.2. Never supplement multivitamins or vitamin “complexes”.Most of these products are laced with cancerous filler materials.3. Never use supplements that have artificial sweeteners and flavorings.They also use cancerous filler materials in them.4. Never use non single ingredient testosterone/hormone boosters.Most of them use poor quality herbs and are focused on the wrong things.For example, some testosterone boosters will indeed increase your testosterone.But they will do this by blocking DHT which will lead to many health issues downthe road.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",371
Page 301,"5. Say no to flavored non grass fed protein powders.Most of them contain a lot of allergens and even heavy metals.The only protein powders that’s relatively safe to consume are organic eggprotein powder and grass fed proteins such as centanarius (expensive).You don’t need protein powders though.7. No pre workouts and ED “supplements”.They raise nitric oxide which leads to severe metabolic damage.You can check this yourselves by seeing how thin the skin of people you regularlyuse pre workout is.8. No BCAAs.Most have heavy metals in them and some very shady forms of silicone.9. No melatonin supplements unless you’re fighting a virus.Synthetic melatonin can even trigger autoimmune diseases.10. No fish oils and omega 3 supplements.Fatty acids in fish oil supplements are oxidized.11. No iron supplements.If you struggle with low levels of iron, then besides including organs and oystersin your diet, start supplementing with vitamin C.Relatively safe supplements (i am repeating myself in some of them so feelfree to skip them)1. Brewer’s yeast.This is probably my favorite supplement.Brewer's yeast is made from a one-celled fungus calledSaccharomycescerevisiaeand is used to make beer.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",292
Page 302,"It has been grown and used as a nutritional supplement for years. It is a richsource of B vitamins(*) and minerals such as selenium.(*)The B-complex vitamins in brewer's yeast include B1 (thiamine), B2(riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), B9 (folic acid),and H or B7 (biotin).These vitamins help break down carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, which providethe body with energy.They also support the nervous system, help maintain the muscles used fordigestion, and keep skin, hair, eyes, mouth, and liver healthy.Thiamine (B1) is also one of the most effective pre workout supplements there is,it is also involved in iron regulation and helps the body excrete any excess.Best time to consume brewer’s yeast?Anytime as long as it is 5-7 hours before your bedtime.2. Magnesium glycinate and threonate(expensive andunnecessary for mostpeople but worth mentioning)Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the human body and it’ssomething most people are deficient in.During digestion, three primary digestive enzymes turn food into nutrients thatcan be absorbed and assimilated by the body and magnesium plays a role innumerous enzyme systems throughout the body.Magnesium directs excessive calcium outside the cell, promoting relaxation in thestressed areas.Magnesium also lowers SHBG levels and therefore it can increase freetestosterone.Magnesium and brewer’s yeast are the first supplements you should buy.The best kind of magnesium is probably magnesium threonate(*) BUT it is veryexpensive and since every form of magnesium tends to go to a specific tissue (forⒸHelios_Movement LLC",389

Thiamine (B1)We already mentioned B vitamins in brewer’s yeast, but unfortunately brewer’syeast is pretty low on thiamine (B1) an absolutely crucial vitamin most people aredeficient in.Vitamin B1 enables the body to use carbohydrates as energy and this is one ofthe reasons why diabetics massively benefit from thiamine supplementation a lotof times.Thiamine isessentialfor glucose metabolism, andplays a key role in nerve,muscle, and heart function.Thiamine can help conditions such as:●AIDS●canker sores●cataracts●glaucoma and other vision problems●cerebellar syndrome, a type of brain damage●cervical cancer●diabetic pain●stress●heart disease●kidney disease in patients with diabetes type 2●motion sickness●a weakened immune system.Note: Do not supplement with thiamine for more than 3-5 weeks.Best time to consume thiamine?With the pre workout meal.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",287
Page 304,"4. NiacinNiacin is another B vitamin which is called vitamin B3.Niacin is used from the body in order to break down fats and protein, convertingfood into energy and cellular metabolism.Niacin works with enzymes to metabolize food calories and absorb nutrientswhich are spread throughout the organs and muscles of the body, providing themwith continual energy.It is water-soluble, so our bodies do not store it, which also means that your bodycan excrete excess amounts of the vitamin through urine if they are not needed.Niacin has an essential role in cell signaling and DNA repair.Niacin also boosts hydration in the skin and a cell's ability to retain water and itmay help prevent certain types of skin cancer as well, as studies found thatparticipants who took niacin twice a day had reduced rates of nonmelanoma skincancer compared to the control group.The brain also requires niacin (NAD and NADP) to get energy and functionproperly.Important note:Start with a very small dose (50-100mg),do not supplement withnon flush niacin, do not exceed 200 mg, always take niacin with food and do notsupplement with niacin for more than 3-4 weeks straight.Best times to consume niacin?In the morning with breakfast as you saw in the previous part of the course.5. Vitamin CVitamin C is necessary for the growth, development and repair of all body tissues.Not only that but it’s extremely important for our endocrine system.Vitamin C is a precursor to:1.Collagen synthesis2.Cholesterol synthesis3.Bile acid synthesis and even helps iron homeostasis.Vitamin C can help the body form HDL, improve blood pressure, reduce blooduric acid, improve testosterone levels, reduce cancer risk, improve cellularⒸHelios_Movement LLC",403

TaurineTaurine has important functions in theheartandbrainand it helps support nervegrowth.The main roles of taurine in your body are:●maintaining proper hydration and electrolyte balance in your cells●forming bile salts, which play an important role in digestion●regulating minerals such as calcium within your cells●supporting the general function of your central nervous system and eyes●regulating immune system health and antioxidant functionPerformance wise, taurine showed in athletes:●increased oxygen uptake by the body●increased time to fatigue●reduced muscle damage●improved recovery times●improved strength and powerBest time to consume taurine?It depends on the individual.Some people benefit from A.M supplementation and some from late P.M.But since taurine can give you an energy boost, i suggest trying it first in the A.Mhours in case you consider supplementing with it.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",275

NAC and ALABoth of these are powerful antioxidants and should only be used undercircumstances of stress (*) in order to help the body replenish glutathione (anantioxidant that is used by the liver in order to detox our bodies).(*)Drinking alcohol, too much sun exposure, ex addicts etc.I personally prefer and recommend ALA between these 2.ALA stands for Alpha-Lipoic-Acid and is an organic compound in the body thatacts as an antioxidant, is present in mitochondria and helps enzymes turnnutrients into energy.Ala can in general help you with :1.Lowering CRP levels2.High blood sugar3.Oxidative stress4.High LDL5.High triglycerides6.Protect the brain and CNS7.Detoxify mercury from the brain8.Reduce iron in tissuesBest times to consume ALA or NAC?ALA can be an extremely effective pre workout supplement so the best time toconsume it would be with the pre workout meal and NAC is good for any time inthe day.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",242

BoronThe element boron is a trace mineral and found in deposits in the earth's crustand sea water.Boron is typically used to increase free testosterone but it will also help your bodyin many more biological processes since it helps recycle electrolytes.Besides these, boron: a) enhances steroid hormones that prevent calcium lossand bone demineralization, b) regulates vitamin D (*) c) displaces fluoride fromthe glands, and d) lowers the calcification of the soft tissue.(*)If you get plenty of sun and your vitamin D levelsare still low, you may besuffering from a boron deficiency which is not uncommon.During boron deficiency our body excretes higher levels of 24-hydroxylase,an enzyme that destroys vitamin D.Best time to consume boron?5-7 hours before your bedtime and with a meal since it requires an insulin spikein order to be absorbed.10. Ginkgo BilobaGinkgo biloba (or maidenhair) is a tree native to China that has been grown forthousands of years for a variety of uses.Because it’s the only surviving member of an ancient order of plants, it’ssometimes referred to as a living fossil.While its leaves and seeds are often used in traditional Chinese medicine,modern research primarily focuses on ginkgo extract, which is made from theleaves.It contains high levels of flavonoids and terpenoids, which are compounds knownfor their strong antioxidant effect.It also works amazingly against depression and stress while not having the sideeffects of herbs such as ashwagandha.Best time to consume ginkgo?

Page 314,"2.21 Testosterone introductionTestosterone is an important but misunderstood molecule as most hormones are.Increasing one’s testosterone levels can both help him and harm him.Testosterone for example can help anxiety but it can also cause anxiety if wedon’t look at things holistically.Not looking things holistically in the human body might be good for instagramposts and grabbing people’s attention, but are we actually helping someone atthe end of the day with this half-knowledge we present?Testosterone (and other androgens) are anabolic.The term anabolic describes growth where cells actually increase in size notachieved by inflammation and swelling.Anabolism, rather than inflammation, is where cells create structures which arepersistent and lasting.My personal testosterone numbers are at 980-ish and obviously all the otherimportant numbers are also on point. I’ve gone from 700-ish all the way to1200-ish (naturally) and from what i’ve experienced myself and clients and readover the last 7 years, for most people the ideal range is between 800 and 1050.The first distinction we must make when discussing testosterone, is to startthinking about “unopposed” testosterone since elevated testosterone is not theonly metric that matters.Now here are the basic lab tests that you can get in order to better understandyour current androgen health.The best time to test androgens is 9-10A.M since they peak early on the day andcan show a false positive result.•First we have total testosteroneⒸHelios_Movement LLC",335
Page 315,"This is the testosterone that is also bound to albumin and SHBG.The normal range for free testosterone is 600 - 1000 ng/dL but from working withmany clients, ideally you want a range of 800+ng/dL.We cover the best nutrients to optimize testosterone on the lethal T nutrientcombo (see page..)•Then we have your free testosterone which is the testosterone that is not boundto SHBG or albumin and is often referred to as bioactive testosterone. 2-4% ofthe total testosterone levels is bioactive.Ideally you want a range of70-200 pg/mL of free testosterone.The best nutrients to optimize free testosterone are vitamin D, magnesium andboron.•Then we have estradiol and prolactin which when elevated destroy men’s fertility,libido, thyroid and mood.Ideally when it comes to estradiol levels you want a range of 10–40 pg/mL andprolactin levels below 17 ng/ml.The best nutrients to optimize prolactin are taurine, vitamin D and K2.•Then we have SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin) which is a protein thatbinds to testosterone (the more SHBG you have the less your free testosterone).Ideally when it comes to SHBG you want levels of 15 - 40 nmol/L.In order to optimize SHBG first pay special attention to the xenoestrogen detoxpart and focus on the thyroid supportive diet plan for up to 4 weeks which hasmany of the nutrients you need to lower SHBG such as vitamin E, choline,vitamin C and so on.• Last but definitely not least, we have LH and FSH which stimulate sperm andtestosterone production.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",371
Page 316,"Ideally you want a range of 3 - 10 mIU/L.A few things that specifically trigger more LHandFSH production are: cistanche(will help both LH and FSH equally), ginger (will favor LH more) (ginger isextremely effective and in just 90-days it showed a 43% increase in LH and a17% increase in FSH in hypogonadal men), taurine and mucuna.2.22 Anti-testosterone compoundsNow let’s take a look at a few“anti-testosteronecompounds”aka compoundsthat act as testosterone blockers besides PUFAs, xenoestrogens and so on.Number 1: Stress hormonesStress hormones counteract the effects of testosterone partly by promoting itsaromatization into estrogen.Stress hormones slow both the production of testosterone and progesteronewhile also elevating oppositional hormones such as estrogen and cortisol.Cortisol catabolizes muscle like very few things do.Anyone who has experienced an intense stressful period realizes that it’s almostimpossible to gain or even maintain muscle at this state.Why is that?Well the cortisol molecule is a competitor to the testosterone molecule whichmeans that they compete for the same receptors and locations in the body’stissues.The effects of cortisol are aso cumulative, ending up causing more and moredamage as time passes.So what causes the most intense spikes in stress hormones and thus destroystestosterone levels?ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",318
Page 317,"First, alcohol.The body responds to stress through a hormone system called thehypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis.Stimulation of this system results in the secretion of stress hormones (i.e.,glucocorticoids).Alcohol activates the HPA axis and results in elevated glucocorticoid levels.Alcohol does not increase cortisol only for a few hours as some stimulants do, butfor days.So, you can not be a regular drinker and have proper functioning androgens.Avoid it as often as you can and if you are a regular drinker eliminate it for at least8 weeks.Then we have overtraining.Most natural lifters train way too much.Way too much.Muscle building is not only a matter of tearing up muscle fibers.This is ridiculous and the statement more pain more gain even more ridiculous.Gorillas sit all day and have wider shoulders than Mr Olympia.If muscle building was only a matter of training, women who workout just as hardas us would have the same muscle mass as we have.But they have not.Unopposed testosterone is the real muscle builder, not training.If you are a natural lifter, the ideal weight lifting volume depends first of all on yourlifestyle.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",276
Page 318,"Are you a new parent who is sleep deprived and works 17 hours a day forexample?Are you a person with a regular 9-5?Are you a college student?The first metric you should use in order to understand if weightlifting is going tocause an excess spike in stress hormones is if you can train for 30-40 minuteswithout a stimulant.If you can, then you can go workout.If not, rest or go for a walk.Then we have not sleeping enough.Are you sleeping well?If not, there’s no wonder why your testosterone is at 300.Focusing on optimizing your circadian rhythm as demonstrated in lesson 1 willgreatly improve your entire hormonal health and thus testosterone.Then we have the fasting paranoia.Fasting is a strategic tool, not a lifestyle.“But fasting makes me feel good”.Well cocaine and crazy chicks would make you feel good too.But fasting (and crazy chicks) make you “feel” good from all the adrenaline andnot because it’s actually good for your health.Fasting (and crazy chicks) will actually destroy your metabolism if you don’t knowwhat you’re doing.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",258
Page 319,"It is way better to do a 3 day fast every month than it is fast for 23 hours everyday.Get 3 meals a day in if you care about optimizing androgens.A breakfast, a lunch and a dinner.Especially breakfast.Cortisol levels climax early in the morning and if you are like most people whodon’t eat a proper breakfast that has a good amount of protein, a good amount offats and a good amount of carbs (eggs and fruit basically) and drink 400mg ofcaffeine, you’re catabolizing even further.Fructose (fruit) is also a great tool to lower cortisol and i recommend two servingsof fruit daily in case you’re not suffering from candida (see lesson 1).One in the morning and one at night.So, eat.Then we have an inflammatory diet.Are you nurturing your body with food or are you making it even more stressed byeating garbage that it has to go on panic mode in order to process them?What does your diet consist of?Does it consist of grains that tend to raise estrogen?Does it consist of seed oils like canola oil that mess up everything?Try sticking to : meat (both organs and some muscle meat), raw dairy once in awhile, quality fats such as coconut oil, some bone broth rice and fruit for a while.

Page 320,"Then we have an overworked liver through xenoestrogens and a ton ofsupplementsXenoestrogens and tons of supplements are a huge burden to the liver which isresponsible for proper thyroid function.So avoid xenoestrogens as much as you can while detoxing from them (seelesson 1) and treat supplements as specific tools.You would be surprised with how many people actually consume over 20 pills ofsupplements per day.A common cause is also sun exposure without enough antioxidants, zincand cholesterol.Sun is not a problem but can be a big stressor if the right things are not providedthrough one’s diet.If you spend a lot of time in the sun (the ideal number for health reasons seemsto be 2 hours a day) make sure to consume animal foods from muscle meats toeggs and also you might need to supplement with vitamin C and eat some kernelpalm oil.Stress will also deplete nutrient stores such as: copper, magnesium, vitamin C,vitamin A, B vitamins, sodium and even vitamin K which all play a key role fortestosterone production.In order to lower stress hormones and thus improve androgen health, trythe following.#1 Ground twice dailyGrounding restores and maintains the body’s natural electrical state which in turnpromotes optimum health.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",282
Page 321,"Your body becomes suffused with negative charged free electrons that arepresent on the surface of the Earth and your body equalizes to the same electricenergy level as the Earth.Free electrons from grounding reduce oxidative stress produced by EMFs.Grounding reduces inflammation and improves blood flow which result in calmingarrhythmias, lowering blood pressure and improving blood oxygenation.Get as many minutes as you can during the day and consider purchasing somegrounding sandals.#2 Fructose (fruit)Fructose lowers cortisol and boosts your metabolism in a level so phenomenal itwould be stupid to ignore.Carbohydrates are the most efficient source of energy we humans have accessto.Fruits also produce way more CO2 than fats and protein in general and CO2 is agood thing since it decreases oxidative damage.#3 Magnesium and sea saltIt is a fact that most people are magnesium deficient.Magnesium deficiency can lead to glutamate overactivity.Salt will help balance insulin which always gets out of whack during stressfulperiods.#4 NACNAC can be pretty effective for lowering cortisol and you might want to give it atry.Just make sure to have enough copper from your weekly organ meats.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",255
Page 322,"#5 Do a dopamine detoxOverstimulation can in fact cause a rapid increase in stress hormones and mostpeople today are overstimulated.It’s almost impossible to avoid this unless you plan on strategic dopamine fast.My personal recommendation are spending some time in relative silenceeveryday (go for a walk in nature) and one regular dopamine detox for 2-3 daysevery month.#6 250mg of vitamin C and 25-50mg of quality vitamin E or palm kernel oil 4times a week.The adrenal glands dump vitamin C when cortisol is released and it is best tosupplement with a low dose in case you’re having (or had) a pretty stressfullifestyle.Also vitamin C is vital not only to produce healthy cholesterol but to utilize it aswell. Note: Vitamin C requires sodium to be absorbed into the body so don’t skipsea salt.#7 Saturated fatsKeep the saturated fats at least at 25% of your daily calories (just do not combinehigh fat with high carb) and PUFAs as low as you can.Rats who were fed coconut oil for example daily for 60 days, had a)lower stresslevels in their testes and b)significantly higher testosterone levels compared tothose who were fed olive oil, soybean oil, canola oil etc. Saturated fats arenecessary for our health.#8 Copper (obviously do not over do it)Replacement of copper by iron in someone’s diet will dramatically increaseestrogen (a stress hormone) so addressing unbound iron as you saw in lesson 1ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",335
Page 323,"and including a nice source of copper:zinc in someone’s diet, will be beneficial aswell.#8 Other things you can use to reduce cortisol and stress hormones are:liquorice extract (it inhibits the enzyme 11B HSD), siberian (avoid panax) ginseng,B vitamins and if you are over 27, short term and low dose DHEA andpregnenolone use.Number 2: AromataseThe aromatase enzyme activity is a natural process to keep homeostasis in themale and female body.Aromatase, also known as estrogen synthase, is a member of the cytochromeP450 superfamily which can flip high amounts of testosterone into estrogen.In order to optimize aromatase, first someone needs to minimize stress with theways we just saw and also eliminate alcohol.Then he can use some dietary aromatase inhibitors such as palm kernel oil,EVOO, citrus fruits (orange juice, pomegranate and grapefruit juice with no pulp),chamomile and mushrooms.Number 3: SHBGSex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) binds to sex hormones in the so SHBGbinds to testosterone and an increase in SHBG can be detrimental to freetestosterone levels.If someone wants to lower SHBG, first he needs to stop consuming alcohol anddetox from xenoestrogens.Then he can use magnesium and boron.Magnesium binds to SHBG and boron supplementation has been shown todecrease SHBG levels as well besides sunlight which is probably the mosteffective way to decrease SHBG.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",348
Page 324,"Optimizing glucose metabolism will also be crucial since SHBG can be increasedby insulin resistance.Number 4: PhytoestrogensPhytoestrogens are present in certain edible plants being most abundant in soy,they are structurally and functionally analogous to the estrogen and have alsobeen classified as endocrine disruptors.Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can interfere with endocrine (orhormone) systems at certain doses.These disruptions can cause cancerous tumors, birth defects, and otherdevelopmental disorders.Phytoestrogens can manipulate steroid biosynthesis and transport by for examplestimulating SHBG synthesis in liver cells, and displacing either 17β-estradiol ortestosterone from plasma SHBG.This deflection of the quantity or availability of SHBG by phytoestrogens changesthe free fraction of endogenous hormones in circulation systemically or locally.Even though some studies (some of them good and some of them bad) haveshown some benefits for women, it is better to avoid phytoestrogens for men andalso for anyone who is under 21 since some studies have shown increasedinfertility.What you should avoid most :- Soy/Soy products- Flax- Tempeh- Sesame seeds- BeerⒸHelios_Movement LLC",272
Page 325,"Number 5: Phytic acid, lignans, glycyrrhizic acid and beta glucan.Phytic acid is a substance which easily and readily binds to many essentialminerals and nutrients in the body. In a study reviewing this substance, scientistsconcluded that the consumption of foods which contain Phytic Acid is likely themain reason humans all across the world have micronutrient deficiencies.Lignans are an estrogenic compound to the point of doctors using lignans inorder to decrease testosterone levels in women who experience hightestosterone.Glycyrrhizic acid has been shown to reduce testosterone levels by blocking itsproduction in the Leydig cells in the testes. Glycyrrhizic acid can lowertestosterone by up to 300 ng/dL in just 4 days (look it up).Beta glucan has been promoted as a “cholesterol lowering substance”.The problem with this is that beta glucan is a powerful anti-androgen compound.2.23 Pro testosterone food list1)Free range eggsFree range eggs are an excellent source of bioavailable protein, choline,selenium, vitamin A, vitamin K, B vitamins, saturated fats, cholesterol and containall the elements that a little chicken needs to be born.When having eggs, do not drink them raw. The raw egg whites will destroy yourstomach and deplete you of B vitamins (the egg whites are there to protect theyolk).Instead cook the eggs until the egg whites are cooked but the yolks remain raw.How many should you consume? 2-5 eggs a day are enough.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",350
Page 326,"After this, there are actually not many benefits (i’ve had many clients that theirhealth was wrecked from drinking 12 eggs a day) and if you are not micronutrientbalanced already (most are not) there can be some side effects as well.2)Raw dairyRaw dairy are an excellent source of pro testosterone nutrients such as zinc,vitamin A, CLA and even iron binders such as lactoferrin.Raw dairy products are an excellent source of milk bioavailable calcium andvitamin K2 and as we saw, since most people consume way too muchphosphorus and not enough calcium, raw dairy will greatly help their thyroid andthus metabolic health.Raw milk is also a great recovery tool due to the high L glutamine amount.3)Grass fed/organic organ meats (especially beef and goose liver).Organ meats are the most nutrient dense foods on the planet and you shouldalways invest in them first.100 grams of organic/grass fed liver will provide way more nutrients than 100gr oforganic fruit.

They have anincredible amino acid balance and greatlty help the production of sex hormonesD-Aspartic-Acid and N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA).Cooking the oysters does decrease the amount of these amino acids though soit’s best to be eaten raw.You can cook other shellfish such as crab, shrimp or mussels that are incrediblyhigh in glycine.The best time to consume oysters is 4-7 hours prior to bed time/sex aka at lunch.5)Coconut oil and EVOOIn many experiments, rats who were fed coconut oil daily had lower stress levelsin their testes and significantly higher testosterone levels.The caprylic acid in coconut oil(a type of saturatedfatty acid) also hasantibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and anti-inflammatory properties and canspeedup the T4 to T3 conversion.When it comes to EVOO, since a lot of them are laced with inferior oils, makesure that your EVOO is in a glass bottle and has a deep dark green/golden-ishcolor. It should also become solid when refrigerated.EVOO consumed daily, can increase testosterone by up to 17% in 3 weeks.6)Pomegranate juice (no pulp)Pomegranate juice is a health elixir.One study in people with diabetes showed that 1 cup of pomegranate juicelowered CRP and interleukin-6 ( inflammatory markers that cancer patients haveelevated) by 30-32%.Citrus fruit can also bind SHBG.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",378
Page 328,"Testosterone wise, a study showed a 24% increase in saliva testostosterone injust 14 days of consuming pomegranates.Pomegranate juice has also been shown to increase the 1rp of olympic athletes.The juice part is important since pomegranates contain one of the highest levelsof phytoestrogens.Drinking only the juice should help you avoid these though, as it is typically theflesh and seeds which contain phytoestrogen.I recommend pomegranate juice pre or post lift and when sunbathing.7)Local raw honeyRaw honey is a great enzyme, mineral and trace mineral source.Only four tablespoons contain the daily requirements of many of them such aspotassium and even boron.Local raw honey will also provide some immunity against pollen allergens.8)(Raw) Garlic and onionsBesides being a great antibacterial, garlic contains allicin which lowers cortisollevels and this can improve testosterone.It also contains diallyl disulfide which can increase testosterone levels in thetestes.Onions are an excellent source of B6, allicin and quercetin and can increasetestosterone levels by over 100% in 4 weeks.Both of these were also mentioned in the sulfur part and will also help in ironhomeostasis.9)Grass fed/finished red meatAim for grass finished meats if you can to avoid chemicals or traces of antibiotics.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",310
Page 329,"Non grass finished cows are treated with extra estrogen since it pseudo helpsthem to grow faster (in reality it just produces more inflamed muscle tissue) andthis leeches into their meat.Obviously red meat is a great source of zinc, a lot of B vitamins and selenium.10)Brazil nutsBrazil nuts (besides targeted sprouted almond supplementation) are the only nutsi recommend someone consume occasionally.They are rich in selenium, vitamin E, zinc, magnesium, they have a good-ishsaturated/unsaturated fat ratio (2:1) and they are low in phytosterol.That being said, do not consume more than 3-4 a day.11) Raisins and red grapesThese are a great source of boron and resveratrol which has been linked toTestosterone production and lower estrogen levels in men.Chinese researchers found that around 500mg (the amount in 5-10g) of redgrape skins was enough to raise testosterone levels, and increase sperm swimstrength.12)White button mushroomsWhite button mushrooms are great to decrease estrogen and remove endotoxinsbesides them being high in vitamin B6.The polysaccharides in them have been shown to block the effects of thearomatase enzyme.13)White fishI want to attack all the metrosexuals that say white fish are filled withmicroplastics and thus have zero clue of the digestive system of these animals.Shrimp is another story*ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",318
Page 330,"White fish are an excellent source of minerals such as selenium and the close tozero PUFA content makes them one of the best foods combined with coconut oilto consume in order to restore the saturated fats in one's body and thus increasethe health of Leydig cells.I personally add some ginger to them as well since ginger will also greatlyimprove androgen function (it can increase testosterone by up to 17.7%).15)Bone marrow and saltBone marrow is a great source of collagen, aminos, minerals, trace minerals andfat soluble vitamins.Salt will greatly support adrenals, thyroid, reduce stress and thus improvetestosterone.2.24 Lethal T nutrient combinationCombination of nutrients that have shown to increase testosterone levels by up to250%.Choline + Vitamin A + Vitamin D + Vitamin E + vitamin K2 + Zinc + VitaminB3Choline has the ability to methylate ( methylation is a process that involves theremoval of one methyl group from one substance, placing it on anothersubstance and takes place predominantly within the liver.Another important methylator besides choline is vitamin B12) to estrogenmolecules leading to a change in the shape of said molecules and thus theycannot bind well to its dedicated receptors in the body and can be excreted out ofthe body.3 free range eggs a day and your weekly beef liver will cover your choline needs.Vitamin A has been found in many studies to help suppress estrogen productionin the male testes and rats with a greater concentration of Vitamin A in the testeswere found to have increased base testosterone secretion.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",342
Page 331,"Not only that but when rats were given diets deficient in Vitamin A, theirtestosterone levels not only decreased but their testicles began to atrophy andthe inner layer of the testicles was lost.In human studies, vitamin A has been found equally effective to theadministration of testosterone on teenagers with delayed pubertal onset.Today, most people do not consume nearly enough dietary vitamin A (vitamin Dand beta carotene which are needed for the proper use of vitamin A)Vitamin A should never be supplemented and only consumed through foods suchas organ meats (with a sulfur rich food such as onions or garlic in order toprevent the over absorption of iron), raw milk and free range eggs.I personally prefer and have seen the most success in clients when theyconsume free range eggs 4 times a week, organ meats 2-3 times a week for nomore than 150 grams at a time and raw milk even every day.Vitamin D is a key vitamin related to the production and increase of testosteronebut also in the proper utilization of vitamin A.A deficiency in vitamin D causes many problems, from low testosterone, anxiety,depression, vision problems, ED, hair loss, thyroid problems (big one) and so on.The testicles also contain receptors for Vitamin D.Vitamin D directly affects the amount of total but also free testosterone in ourblood.Our bodies naturally produce vitamin D when we expose our skin to the sun andwe should favor sunlight for vitamin D over supplements.But if you live in the northern hemisphere and sunlight levels are low in the wintermonths, you can supplement a liquid vitamin D supplement with liquid vitamin K2as long as you keep vitamin A rich foods in your diet.Vitamin E affects testicular and hormonal health, but also as we said helps uscombat the oxidative damage that PUFAs have caused and helps the body fromⒸHelios_Movement LLC",392

Page 333,"Testosterone wise, vitamin B3 has been found as one of the most effective waysto treat age related steroid deficiency.Secret testosterone nutrient : Vitamin CVitamin C protects the Leydig cells in the testes from oxidative stressors,up-regulates enzyme activity in them and can even regenerate damagedtestosterone molecules! Vitamin C will increase sperm count, protect the thyroid,reduce cortisol and improve sleep quality.The testosterone meal plan that will be presented to you pays special attention tothese key nutrients you just saw.I have used this nutrient combination in many clients in order to increase theirtestosterone levels from the mid 300s all the way to even 700s which makes itmore effective than conventional TRT.Two key nutrients for free testosterone1) MagnesiumMagnesium lowers the levels of unbound SHBG in the body, by binding to itleading to more free Testosterone in the body by levels up to 40% in somestudies. In these studies a daily dose of 10mg of magnesium per kg was used.It is better to break your daily dose into smaller multiple doses and consumethroughout the day (most studies have demonstrated this) than to consume onesingle dose every day.Magnesium will also greatly protect you against nnEMF.Magnesium needs vitamin D and B6 in order to be more bioavailable so makesure besides getting sunlight in to consume your beef liver and on the days youdon’t, some prunes or sardines.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",315
Page 334,"2) BoronBoron can both boost free testosterone and block excess estrogen in the bodyfrom being used.In several studies, 10mg of boron was given to men each day for 7 days whichled to an increase of free testosterone levels by 28.3%, decreasing estrogenlevels by 39% and significantly decreasing SHBG levels as well.Boron will also help the homeostasis of minerals as well.If you supplement with boron, 6-9mg per is enough.Chamomile nationalism?From a scientific standpoint, chamomile is great for your testosterone.It contains apigenin which helps deliver cholesterol to the mitochondria in thetestes and without sufficient amounts of apigenin, your testes can not produceenough testosterone but it also contains chrysin which helps to block the enzymearomatase.But unfortunately regular chamomile tea is not enough in order to producenoticeable effects testosterone wise (obviously though, it is not useless).If you are going to use chamomile in order to specifically optimize testosterone,you will either need to use big amounts or use a concentrated formula and maketea out of it.The same thing applies for other herbs such as passion flower which also containchrysin.

Page 337,"Then, they have enough cholesterol which is the building block of testosterone.We also did not skip on the carbs which will have pro thyroid and anti stresseffects (and insulin is also a great way to lower SHBG).The protein is relatively high which will lead to increased free testosterone andlower SHBG.We have balanced the aminos properly from the sea food, bone marrow andbone broth.We have included pomegranate, cacao, ginger, palm kernel oil, EVOO, coconutoil, onions, garlic and many of the foods proven to boost T but also things suchas sperm count which are declining rapidly.The oysters and seafood will increase LH and FSH.It has more than enough vitamin A in it so aromatase will be low (when there is avitamin A deficiency, aromatase activity goes through the roof).And we have more anti-estrogenic compounds such as vitamin K2 and vitamin E.Last but not least, the copper: iron ratio is optimal so estrogen will not go onoverdrive through an iron excess.Now, obviously the things we saw in the previous part of the course such asmitochondrial health, optimizing sleep, healing your metabolism and thyroid,detoxing from PUFAs, xenoestrogens and heavy metals will all play a veryimportant role in testosterone optimization.Other tips that will help you optimize testosterone are to have the proper body fatpercent, this is9-15% bf for men and 13-20%bf forwomen.Maintaining a healthy body fat percentage is also a thing to keep in mind foranyone who wants to have healthy testosterone levels.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",353
Page 338,"After a certain point, as the fat increases, there is an increase in activity of theenzyme aromatase which converts testosterone in the fat cells to estrogen.This reduces testosterone and increases estrogen, which can increase fatdeposition in typical female areas (breast, hips, thighs) and increase the risk ofenlargement of the prostate and even prostate cancer.If you are more than 20 pounds overweight, you likely have high estrogen,skewed leptin levels, lowered testosterone and are insulin resistant.If you are over 20% bf (for men) as many men are today, with every one pointdrop in your body mass index (BMI) your testosterone level can increase by even50 points.So the fat loss manifesto could be very useful to boost testosterone in the caseyou are struggling with excessive fat.

Page 339,"2.26 High T moodMotivation in today’s society is overrated and biology underrated. The bodyinfluences the mind more than many people would like to admit.So in this part we will see how you can optimize your mood through biology.First of all, without proper functioning testosterone levels the dysfunction ofglucocorticoid hormones will inevitably lead to stress and anxiety as well as thedecrease in alpha brain waves without even mentioning the fact that lowtestosterone leads to a wild serotonin excess and thus low dopamine, GABA anddepression. Then you have to tackleexcessive serotonin.Most myths around serotonin are busted so far and people realize now that’sactually a stress hormone and a very powerful one.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",163
Page 340,"A serotonin excess will lead to generalized anxiety, learned helplessness, overanalytical personality (stress sourced), phobias and great dopamine and GABAimbalances in general.First of all, try ginkgo biloba (50:1) which has opposite effects of serotonin (itincreases blood flow to the brain (serotonin reduces it)) and can normalizeelevated catecholamine.Then get on bone broth since most people have mega dosed on tryptophan fromall the muscle meats which is a serotonin agonist and glycine will mitigate theexcessive tryptophan and aid in serotonin clearance.Have the Ray P inspired salad 3-6 times a week.The salad is made up of: chopped carrots, ACV, ginger, 25-50 grams of beefliver, blackseed oil, coconut oil and sea salt.The fibers in raw carrots will bind to excessive estrogen, the ginger will lowerserotonin receptivity in the gut and the blackseed oil since it can lower serotoninuptake from the gut.Then, do not fast and have eggs for breakfast for at least 4 weeks if you aresuffering from mood issues.Do not fast.If you fast, adrenaline will go on overdrive unless you are living in a cabin or havea very very low stress life.Then since adrenaline is made from dopamine, this will create a dopaminedeficiency and lead to a serotonin excess.We added the eggs since choline will increase dopamine receptor densities.Note: a promoter of adrenaline excess is zinc deficiency, so never forget to eatyour weekly serving of oysters.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",342
Page 341,"What is also cool, is that many people have reported their perfectionism wentaway after they addressed excessive serotonin.If you struggle with over analytical thought patterns, give the above cheet sheet ago(*) for 4 weeks and see if your thought process improves(*)Besides getting on B1,B2, getting plenty of B12 and choline which can also bea common cause for this. Way more common than some short of psychologicalissue.Another example of this (how high serotonin can lead to over analytical thoughtpatterns) is when people who start “fasting” with black coffee, report that they aremore “sharp”. This might be the case if you were eating twinkies for breakfast, butit is generally a lie and a very harmful one.You are not more “sharp”. Your mental patterns are on overdrive due to a rise incortisol and adrenaline.When you fast like this, you think more. Your thought process though did notbecome more effective which is the entire point.A breakfast made out of eggs cooked in some coconut oil, fruit and yerba mate incase your liver is fine and can handle some caffeine, is undefeated for realmental performance.But let’s get back to the main topic.You should obviously also learn how to properly identify and detox fromxenoestrogens as you saw in the previous part.A minimum of 2 hours of natural light should be implemented in your daily routinesince without it dopamine will once again decrease and you will face moodissues.It doesn't matter if it is a sunny day. Spend a minimum of 2 hours outside everyday.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",348
Page 342,"Optimize GABA as you saw in the previous part.Vitamin C can also help due to its natural progesterone enhancing effects.Other things that can negatively affect your mood as a man are aromatase,SHBG and prolactin.So make sure to add some dietary aromatase inhibitors such as palm kernel oil,EVOO, citrus fruits (pomegranate and grapefruit juice with no pulp), chamomile,coconut and mushrooms.You should obviously not skip on vitamin K2 rich foods since the brain is one ofthe organs containing the highest concentration of K2 and protects neurons fromoxidative stress.A choline deficiency is linked with many neurodegenerative diseases so havingegg yolks and organ meats will also be crucial to optimize your mood.Keep the protein relatively high since it provides the building blocks forneurotransmitters.And obviously also make sure to address blue light as you saw in the previouspart since it greatly lowers dopamine, and social media is known to destroydopamine sensitivity.Prolactin is a dopamine antagonist and vitamin B6 is a great prolactin antagonist.So make sure to consume enough vitamin B6 as well (which is also crucial foroverall androgen health).A men's health mood improvement stack that i've given many times, includes:-Taurine-Ginkgo-Vitamin C-Magnesium glycinateⒸHelios_Movement LLC",302

Page 344,"You want to naturally restore a healthy nitric oxide production and not artificially.Focus on natural things that can stimulate the synthesis of nitric oxide such as afunctioning NAD+ pathway (see previous part), garlic, onions, vitamin C since itfacilitates the enzymes which synthesize endothelial nitric oxide, lower aromataseactivity (you might have to lose body fat if you are a male above 15% bf),prolactin and SHBG with strong chamomile tea even and raw dairy with addedhoney, plenty of sunlight during the day and also perhaps, boron.Obviously, without a proper functioning glucose metabolism nitric oxide can beproperly produced as well.Not only that but since insulin resistance will lead to nerve damage it willinevitably lead to erectile dysfunction.If you experience ED, you must obviously eliminate alcohol, phytoestrogens,PUFAs, gluten, food additives, artificial sweeteners, too much caffeine, workingout like a maniac, stop fasting for 23 hours a day, staying up late, not performingany cardio and skipping legs, detox from unbound iron and xenoestrogens.You should then increase the saturated fats, bioavailable calcium and enoughcalcium regulators such as magnesium, K2, D and even B12 (not directly acalcium regulator but people with gut issues (especially an ammonia excess)need it in order to properly absorb the calcium).Royal jelly is also a great tool for ED since it will support the conversion fromDHEA to testosterone. But it should be taken with breakfast in order to maximizeits effects.Another important molecule for erection is carbon dioxide which is partlyresponsible for arousal by the relaxation of the blood vessels.In case you’re experiencing ED then, thiamine (B1) supplementation with a mealthat includes fructose (fruit), protein and some fats, will be very beneficial but itcan take up to 2 weeks to notice any real effects.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",416
Page 345,"Other common causes of ED are:-A deficiency in fat soluble vitamins (especially K2 and A)-Boron deficiency-Not optimal zinc:copper ratio or even a zinc deficiency (especially in people withcompromised guts)-Heavy metal toxicity (mainly unbound iron and aluminum)-Mineral imbalances-Candida-Glyphosate (get rid of most grains and sprouted ones)-Not enough sulfur and cholesterol-High oxalates in the diet (this is why beet juice is a double edge sword and oneshould not start there) and last but not least, megadosing on lysine.-Selenium deficiencyExcessive lysine (not balanced properly with other aminos) will put nitric oxideproduction to sleep and inevitably lead to ED besides skyrocketing the productionof adrenaline.Lysine also competes with arginine and causes an endless list of arousalproblems.You do not have to worry about this though, if you stick to the balanced aminoprofile that you saw in this course.So here’s your priority list when it comes to ED.Number 1: Improve your thyroid performance and address unbound iron whichcan increase estrogen especially in androgenic tissues that are crucial forarousal.Number 2: Optimize NAD+ pathways and CO2Number 3: Lower excess serotonin through endotoxin clearance (if your gut isfine, then organic oat bran with some coconut oil, cacao, raw honey and somereishi mushroom once in a while (once every 10 days), can be a very effectivetool for this) and optimize GABA.Number 4: Optimize gut health and pay special attention to the SIBO tips.Number 5: Get plenty of vitamin D (if you get plenty of sunlight and still yourⒸHelios_Movement LLC",380

It is a side effect and not its goal.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",430
Page 347,"It is not uncommon that people who face the most intense anxiety problems arealso the people with the higher libidos.And now you understand the underlying cause of this.The people who experience this, want to have sex just to get rid of the discomfortthat excess nitric oxide is causing them.This is the sole goal and not normal.*The same is true for women with an overactive sex drive as we see nowadays*The intense sex drive most people experience today is a sign of stress, nothealth.Again, there is a reason (aka stress hormones) why most people in the healthindustry who struggle with PE are carnivores.What you must do then if you struggle with PE, is first of all, stabilize your bloodsugar levels and this is one of the very few scenarios that a low glycemic indexdiet (but not for dinner on which you will need at least 50-75 grams of carbs if youwant to get decent sleep), can be useful forsomepeoplewho also do not haveaccess to much sunlightsince you can’t afford theexcess cortisol andadrenaline that blood sugar swings will cause but also, the amount of carbs youcan metabolize is directly affected by your light environment.Then there are two key nutrients that will greatly help you fix PE.Taurine and acetylcholine.Taurine will increase both dopamine and GABA (which is anti erectile/ejaculatorywhich is what you want in this case).Premature ejaculation a lot of times is a sign ofnon optimized GABA, highprolactin and low dopamine so taurine will greatly help with all these.Then, acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter for the parasympatheticnervous system which is made from choline and B vitamins (especially B1) andpromotes dopamine production.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",391
Page 348,"Melatonin also directly increases the release of acetylcholine so focus on theentire part in lesson 1 about fixing sleep.Another tip that will greatly help you is learning to breathe during intercorse.Just as when working with individuals that are interested in performance, wehave doubled their endurance and even almost their strength, by teaching themhow to properly breathe when lifting, so can you increase your endurance in bedby learning to breathe deeply during it.Remember that carbon dioxide is partly responsible for arousal and orgasm.By holding your breath and not breathing deeply, you naturally increase the levelsof carbon dioxide in your body and thus you will last less in bed.Now this is tricky. You need a healthy endogenous production of CO2 becausewithout it nitric oxide will be overproduced and harm your metabolic health, butyou do not need to raise CO2 through the breath.It is unnecessary and it will only cause you to not last longer.If you need to use your breath in order to get aroused, you should focus onimproving metabolic health.Last but not least, a common underdiagnosed cause for PE is prostatitis(inflammation of the prostate) which increases its sensitivity to contraction andthus resulting in PE.If that’s the case, then one must cut out grains, inferior fats, dairy for a while (yes,even raw dairy), address possible bacterial overgrowth as you saw in the gut partespecially with a natural antibiotic since bacteria can invade inflamed anddamaged tissue and prevent their healing and bacterial infection could be by itselfa cause of PE.

Page 354,"3.1 How to add muscleLet’s start with the common pitfalls of building muscle.Building muscle requires a positive energy balance, which means that you musttake in more calories than you burn.BUT, your body can build at most around 227g of muscle each week.Which leads us to common pitfall #1 : “Bulking”Bulking in the classical sense (a 500+cal surplus) can be effective for guys thatare either new to the gym or extremely underweighted guys.Your average gym bro that is unfamiliar with health twitter will get insulinresistance sooner or later by eating 6 carb meals a day , avoiding the sun , notdoing cardio and never consuming salmon or ghee since they are “high fat”.This is why “bulking” should be avoided in most cases.What you should focus on instead if you are not a beginner, is for an average 2-3pound weight gain per month after you’ve got your diet on point.Which leads us to common pitfall #2 : inflated expectations.The average 18 year old has more inflated expectations than the inflation of thedollar when it comes to the results he can get as a natty.The best advice i can give to these people is that they can achieve a decentfizeek if they put in the work for at least 5 years and should stop undervaluingwhat they accomplish because they compare themselves to the wrong people.Common pitfall #3 : inconsistencyYou can destroy something you were building all week in one day.It’s very common for people to be disciplined all week and then blow it all off onthe weekend.Two days of partying for example, will destroy 80% of your progress you made inthe gym all week.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",375
Page 355,"Sure, go out , meet women, have fun and so on.But do you honestly need to drink 1 bottle of tequila and eat worse than youraverage normie?You’re throwing away all of your hard work.Pitfall #4: Training too muchAs a natural lifter in order to build muscle , you need to be getting stronger.All the pump work in the world will not save you if you bench 100 pounds.The problem with natties in today’s era is too much isolation work for the smallmuscle groups.For example.Let’s just say you just did a 5x5 bench , if you now continue your workout with 10sets of isolation work for triceps you won’t be getting stronger since your tricepsand tendons can not handle all this volume.So limit the amount of accessory work you’re doing for small muscle groups andstick to the programs i’m about to give you.Your number will go up and you will gain more muscle as a side effect of that.Pitfall #5 : Not enough rest.Most natties that don’t sit all day can recover anywhere from 2-5 hours ofresistance training per week (warm ups not included).If you train more than that , chances are you won’t recover and make the gainsyou can or you will sacrifice your hormonal health for a tiny boost in aesthetics.Last but not least , if you’re not sleeping properly you are not recovering properly.With the proper nutrients in your system , as you sleep , your body will get in anenhanced anabolic state.Every important hormone is produced when you sleep. So implement what youread in lesson 1 when it comes to sleep.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",375

Page 420,"Rest 1-2 minutes between setsDay 6:Rest and perform the planks for 3 sets of 30seconds as you didbefore on rest days.Day 7:Rest3.2 How to lose fat and keep it off once and for all withoutharming your metabolic health.If you want to lose fat, chances are that you have already tried a few times withsome success and some others with not so much.I promise you this though, if you take 1 week to read this, internalize the conceptsthat are presented here and prepare the way that is presented here, you willexperience positive results.That’s the first thing. Before you start your fat loss journey, take a few days toprepare for it. If you don’t, you will fail.Now even though i cringe talking online about such things, here are a fewcommon reasons why most people fail with fat loss that i have seen over andover and over.#1 They have too many goals at once.This 10/10 times results in someone being overworked while achieving nothing.Aka being more busy without accomplishing anything extra.A lot of people underestimate how hard accomplishing worthwhile things actuallyis and think that they can do a zillion different things all at once.You can’t. No one can.Worthwhile pursuits take almost all of our effort and time in order to beaccomplished.So, if you want to lose fat, fat loss should be one of your top (if not the top)priorities.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",329
Page 421,"You have to sit down and tell yourself “okay, for the next 60-90 days, i will focusprimarily on this if i want to accomplish it”.#2 Not taking ownership.During the fat loss process you will fuck up.If you don’t fuck up, you’re not trying hard enough (if you fuck up all the time youare trying too hard though which is also counterproductive).So when you fuck up, accept that it is normal.Don’t take part in the blame game and just get back on track.Ownership is not a “blame game”.This is a common misconception.Owing your problem is basically asking yourself what can I do in order to not fuckup anymore.It’s not this weird “it’s my fault/i’m a piece of shit” mental game that’s been goingon in a lot of circles which will get you more in trouble through shame.Owning your mistakes is saying “i fucked up”, it’s not saying “i’m a fuck up”.Big difference.#3 Not adding new healthy habits.A lot of people quit their bad habits but they do not replace them with better onesso they’re left with nothing.What happens then, is that since you want to feel anything except boredom, yourmind will trick you into believing that things will be different this time if you indulgein your ex bad habits because you need some dopamine hits.So, in order not to relapse you need to find new healthy dopamine sources suchas achieving goals (achieving personal highs is a high like nothing else), workingon your vision etc.Fat loss requires a lifestyle change. Don’t forget that.The thing with lifestyle changes though, is that they also require an identitychange.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",399
Page 422,"In order for this to happen you have to accept that you can not be your “old self”so to speak and you need to focus on conquering a better version of yourself andthis requires pain which brings us to the point of: suffering mentally during thisprocess, is normal.That’s how any type of positive psychological change happens.So, for a successful fat loss to take place, a client needs to accept thatsometimes he or she will suffer and that’s a “good” thing because it signals longterm growth.#4 Thinking that an impulse lasts forever.When you take part on a fat loss journey you will experience impulses to fuck up.What you must learn to do these times is to sit with the impulse as long as youcan.A lot of impulses don’t last long. Some of them don’t last longer than 5 minutes.Do you know how many people don’t lose fat because they can’t sit with animpulse for 10 minutes?Millions.Don’t be one of them.Let’s move on.What do you think is more important for fat loss?The way you eat or the way you train?Well the answer to this is obviously the way you eat.You can’t outlift a bad diet. It is impossible.So we can not have a successful fat loss journey without the client getting familiarwith a few specific diet concepts.Here’s your grocery list for fat lossYou will be consuming the following things in your fat loss journeyⒸHelios_Movement LLC",333

Page 425,"-Some kiwis-Single ingredient spices (most spice “mixes” have dextrose, food additives and amillion other different things).Also, please stop trying to lose weight by destroying your metabolism.Most of the conventional fat loss methods result in long term metabolicdestruction. You don’t need to eat chicken , lettuce and workout 5 hours a day.First start by doing things that arepro metabolicsuch as :- Getting your sleep in order.- Getting in the sun.- Walking 10K steps a day.- Fixing nutrient deficiencies.- Stop working too much.- Getting rid of poisons and providing the proper fuel to your body.After you’ve handled these (which will result in fat loss by themselves most of thetime), then we can talk about more fat loss stuff such as intuitive eating.So please, if you skipped everything on this course and got straight into fat loss,read lessons 1 and 2.Then we must move on to addressing deficiencies.Why?Well because without addressing them fat loss could even be impossible.Why?ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",229
Page 426,"Well if a person for example suffers from a severe B12 deficiency, he can’t loseweight. No, no, no. He/She literally can not.A severe B12 deficiency leads to a person being hungry no matter how muchfood he consumes. He literally can not feel full.The same can be true for a lot of vitamins and minerals.If for example you’re deficient in magnesium, you WILL get wild cravings after aworkout.There are 7 common deficiencies in today’s day and age.Our strategy for fixing them will be targeted supplementation for 1-2 months andthe right diet.Number 1: B vitamin deficiencyWay to fix: Beef liver with brewer's yeast, some extra B1 (thiamine) andoccasionally B3.Number 2: Glutamine and glycine deficiencyWay to fix: Bone broth (you will see the recipe) and quality bone marrow.Number 3: Magnesium deficiencyWay to fix: Magnesium glycinate.Number 4: Vitamin DWays to fix: Sunlight, pectins and perhaps a liquid form of D3 with K2.Number 5: Vitamin AⒸHelios_Movement LLC",249
Page 427,"Ways to fix: Small doses (30grams) of organ meats every day.Can you lose body fat without tracking?Both yes and no.The answer is yes, if you have been eating super clean and you do not sufferfrom a bacterial overgrowth in your gut which results in a false signal of hungerand no if you have one.The most common gut issues you actually mess up people in their fat lossjourneys are candida and SIBO.People who suffer with both of these can actually have a pretty hard time dietingand it’s not a matter of “willpower” or “discipline”.It’s literally 3-4 times harder for them to diet. So implement what you read on thegut part.As you can tell by now, most fat loss approaches do not work because they don’taddress all of these things that we’re talking about here.If a person for example suffers from a B12 deficiency and has candida, he literallyneeds the will power of running an ultra marathon just to cut 2 pounds.I’m not kidding. I’ve seen this time after time after time with real life clients.Fat loss is not a torture, you will suffer but if you suffer 24/7 something’s off.But to get back to the question of if you can lose fat without tracking, yes you canafter you’ve fixed any deficiencies and gut issues.Calories on the labels of food were included in 1990 after all.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",331
Page 428,"There were guys shredded way before calorie labels.(Gironda even competed in the 1950s).So not counting and being lean is 100% possible.The only metrics I have used in order to reach even a 7% bf , were hunger andthe mirror.If you are never hungry during the day, you are at your maintenancecalories or a caloric surplus.If you’re hungry all day and unable to sleep , you’re either training too muchand your stress hormones have become jacked up. Or you are at a too bigof a caloric deficit.That’s all.We will obviously mention macros and calories for people who want tofollow this approach but to get lean you basically must: a) have a healthymetabolism and b) be hungry , but not too hungry.That’s it? Yeah, that’s it after you get familiar with calories, macros and haveinternalized some concepts.Truth is that if you start being health conscious, the mentality that you will gain asa result of this quest will help you be at 10-15%bf almost effortlessly throughstrategic decisions.You will not have a problem “keeping the fat off”.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",260
Page 429,"Now for the people who want to do the calorie and macro counting approach,please do it this way. Here’s some more fat loss tips.Tip 1: Clean up your diet and stick to low dopamine triggering foods.Don’t make dieting more hard than it need to be because you’re over stimulatingyour taste buds (one more reason why i’m against iifym).Consume food. Not drugs.Today’s “foods” are designed to be as addictive as possible resulting in us overeating them.No wonder why most people are “hungry” all the time.They’re not hungry, they experience withdrawals.Food is not supposed to give you heroin-like withdrawals when you don’tconsume it for only a few hours.So stick to clean foods such as the ones we mentioned.Tip 2: If you tend to overeat a certain food. Don’t eat it in “moderation”. Justdon’t eat it. Even if it's “clean”.Tip 3: Find the meals that fill you up for the least amount of calories, makesure they’re micronutrient dense and stick to them.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",273
Page 430,"Finding out the best foods you can feed yourself is a trial & error process. Acceptthis instead of trying to figure out the “perfect” recipe.The best criteria to adhere to are:-How does it digest? ( are you bloated after eating it?)-How does your energy feel after eating it? (do you become energized orlethargic)Tip 4: Do not drink too much water (crucial).Most gym bros consume way too much water.Then they piss a bunch of electrolytes, throw their blood sugar out of whack andget hungry every couple of hours.Consume water with salts and pure electrolytes.Also, consuming too much water destroys your gut acid and leads to all sorts ofbacterial problems.Tip 5: Biweekly liver.One thing that is also crucial when cutting, is making sure to consume50-100grams of beef liver twice a week since B12 greatly regulates your hunger.If you don’t have sufficient B12 levels in your system, you will always be hungry.Tip 6: If you are a beginner, calculate the macros for 20-30 meals so youknow where you’re at calorie wise.Other strategies that help and provide structure for fat loss are:Number 1: Weighing yourself daily.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",277
Page 431,"Number 2: Sticking to only 3 meals a day.Number 3: Prioritizing protein in your meals.Number 4: Do NOT overfill your plate. I can’t even describe how manyclients i had over ate simply because they were filling up their plates too much.Number 5: Not keeping junk in the house.Number 6: Always keeping snacks with you in case you get hungry.Number 7: Don’t try to cut weight too fast. Accept that it takes months.Number 8: When you fuck up (you will fuck up, you’re not a machine),don’t try to overcorrect things by consuming 500 kcals. Get back to the plan.Number 9: Accept that fat loss is a trial and error process with ups and downs. It’snot linear.Number 10: Raw carrots and sparkling water with salt are a great snack to stophunger. Just don’t over do it.Number 11: If you’re not losing weight, add 20 minutes of extra walking during theday. If this does not work cut 200 calories from carbs. Understanding insulinⒸHelios_Movement LLC",247
Page 432,"Insulin is a hormone which is produced by our pancreas and its purpose is to helpglucose in our blood enter cells in our muscles and liver mostly.Every time we eat something our pancreas secretes insulin but the amount ofinsulin depends on a) our metabolic health and b) what we eat.Now, way more people than you think due to a variety of reasons (from lack ofsunlight exposure, PUFAs coming from inferior fat sources such as canola oil,lack of muscle mass etc), have developed something called insulin resistance.Insulin resistance is a condition in which the cells in our muscles, fat and liverdon’t respond properly to insulin and can’t take up glucose from the blood whichresults in our pancreas secreting more and more and more insulin.Why is this bad?Well because when our liver has gotten to the point that it can't utilize glucoseproperly, the metabolic damage we have is pretty severe since the beta cellshave come to the point of not being able to keep the blood glucose levels in thenormal range.We need to have optimized insulin levels not only to lose fat (if you areexperiencing insulin resistance, losing fat is very hard) but for our health ingeneral.The opposite of insulin resistance is insulin sensitivity which leads to the properabsorption and utilization of glucose.Insulin is very, VERY, inflammatory and can lead to systemic inflammation.How to optimize insulin.1) No seed oils/Low PUFA.See lesson 1 (PUFA detox)2)Resistance trainingMuscles use glucose at a phenomenal level.Muscle tissue uses the vast majority of glucose.So before things start getting complicated, lift the way that will be presented toyou.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",375
Page 433,"3) Stick to low glycemic index carbs for 6-12 weeks and use higher indexglycemic carbs only for your post workout meal.Low glycemic index carbs (such as berries for example) are carbs that do notlead to massive insulin releases.Also timing your carb intake is important that’s why the best time to eat a higherglycemic index carb source is post lift.4) Fix B vitamin deficiency.There’s been a bro myth out there that insulin resistance springs from overconsumption of calories, well this might be true but in today’s day and age it alsosprings from malnutrition.When you consume an X amount of calories without also the proper vitamins andminerals that lead to the proper utilization of it, you will face insulin problems.If you struggle with insulin resistance, a short term B vitamin supplementation canbe phenomenal too.5) 3 weeks of ALA followed by 3 weeks of niacinamide the way it waspresented in lesson 1.DO NOT COMBINE THE TWO. EVER.Both ALA and niacinamide are phenomenal tools to help improve insulinresistance.6) Sun and sleepWe already addressed both.What about calories?In order to find your maintenance calories, multiply your weight by 15 (these arealso the calories that you must use in order to recomp) then, substarck 300-500calories out of them (start low).These are the calories that you must follow in order to properly lose fat whilemaintaining muscle and your macronutrient split should be based on themetabolic type you are.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",343

Page 455,"Repeat3.4 How to master bodyweight training.Let’s start with a list of benefits that bodyweight training has:1)Convenience. All you need is a floor and a pull up bar in order to follow thisprogram.That makes it perfect for people that don’t have time to hit the gym or don’t evenhave access to a gym and people who travel a lot.2)It’s a better mood booster than weights since it’s low taxing in your body andnervous system which means that you can train more frequently and experiencean endorphin release more frequently as well as a consequence.3)You have less chances of an injury happening when training with your ownbodyweight.4)You will get gigantic pumps.5)Bodyweight movements are more functional than free weight movements.Functionality is something most people underestimate its importance until theyreach 40. Don’t be like most people.6)If you train in martial arts , bodyweight movements can be a perfectsupplementation to your training. Movements like dips can dramatically increaseyour striking power and speed for example.7)You need to train everything if you want to have longevity as an athlete.8)Less time consuming than going to the gym.9)You can train shirtless without getting kicked out.10)You can build great endurance.11)It’s perfect for beginners and guys that have severe injuries or have reachedplateaus in certain movements such as the bench press.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",326
Page 456,"12)Bodyweight movements activate more core muscles than a lot of weightmovements, so you will develop a great core by default if you are performing theexercises properly.13)In order to progress in bodyweight movements you can’t be fat. You mustkeep your leaness. This does not mean that you’ll be skinny. This simply meansthat you’ll be lean.14)Bodyweight movements will increase balance, coordination and flexibility.Now , some people say that you can’t build a lot of muscle with bodyweighttraining.These people have never been to Santa Monica , seen a gymnast or they don’teven understand that closed chain movements (bodyweight movements) allowfor enhanced muscle fiber recruitment.Moving on.The most common problem bodyweight programs have is that they are notfocused in progression. They go from taking someone who can do 100 push upsand make them do 150. This is kind of useless and can even hurt tendons.It’s way way better to make him do more advanced movements instead.If you want your fizeek to get better , you must progress and get stronger.Your body will not change and build muscle unless it has a reason to.So in this program you will go through the following progressions:-Beginner movements-Intermediate movements-Advanced movementsAnother problem with bodyweight programs is that they are way way complicatedand include weird voodoo movements it’s hard to even remember.One of the reasons I love bodyweight training is that it is so minimalistic and freesup mental space as a byproduct.Before we move on you must learn to recognise and avoid the most commonmistakes when performing bodyweight movements.Avoid the most common mistakesⒸHelios_Movement LLC",372
Page 457,"First learn how to press. We will take push ups as an example but the sameprinciples apply to any pushing movement.Most gym bros might be able to do 50 pushups in one sitting , but they can not do50 pushups with proper technique in one sitting.Since bodyweight movements don’t tax your joints as much , it is pretty easyperforming the exercises wrong without experiencing any side effects.For example if you benched pressed in a 90 degree angle your shoulders wouldget destroyed. But you can get away with doing pushups wrong for a long timebefore this happens.So common mistakes when performing a push movement are : pressing in a 90degree angle (you should find the sweet spot between 50 and 70 degrees) , notengaging your core (extremely important) and your palms looking straight aheadinstead of slightly outwards (this is the most common cause for wrist problemswhen performing push ups).Common mistakes when performing a pull movement are the thumb not goingover the bar and not maintaining a neutral head position.Common mistakes when performing leg movements are not engaging your coreand not performing them barefoot.And a common mistake when performing all of them is locking out your joints.Stop.Now let’s see what movements you’re going to perform in this program.1) Push variationsGreat exercises to build your chest , shoulders , triceps, pressing strength ingeneral and the abdominals.The push progress in this program is as follows :-Incline (40 degrees) push ups-Regular push ups-Decline (20-40 degrees) push ups-Bar dips-Dips-Pike push ups-One hand push upsⒸHelios_Movement LLC",353
Page 458,"-Handstand push upsThe “with which one should I start” answer.If you can not perform 15 reps incline push ups you should start with them untilyou can perform 4 sets of 15 reps.If you can do 4 sets of 15 reps of incline pushups, move on to regular push upsafter warming up with 1-2 sets of incline ones.If you can perform 25+ reps of incline push ups , start with regular push ups fromthe get go.If you can perform 4 sets of 15 reps of regular push ups, move on to decline pushups after warming up with 2 sets of regular ones and you’ll start throwing in thereregular dips and bar dips as well.Always make sure to warm up with regular push ups before jumping to declineones.If you can perform 4 sets of 15 reps of decline push ups, move on to pikepushups after you’ve warmed up with regular and decline pushups for 1-2 setseach.After you’ve managed to progress to the point you’re able to perform 4 sets of10-12 reps of pike push ups your fizeek will look great and you’ll need to mastersome of the core movements in order to progress to the last stage of one handpush ups and handstand push ups.2) Pull variationsGreat exercises to build your back , biceps, grip strength in general and critical inorder to develop that aesthetic V taper.The pull progress in this program is as follows :-Assisted chin ups/Assisted neutral grip pull ups/Dip bar rows (treat them as thesame exercise in this phase)-Assisted pull ups-Chin ups-Pull ups-One arm assisted (with a towel) chin ups-One arm assisted (with a towel) pull ups-One arm chin upsⒸHelios_Movement LLC",395
Page 459,"-One arm pull upsThe “with which one should I start” answer.If you can not perform 8 reps of assisted chin ups you should start with them untilyou can perform 4 sets of 6 reps.If you can do 4 sets of 6 reps of assisted chin ups, move on to assisted pull ups.If you can perform 15 reps of assisted pull ups , move on to chin ups until youcan perform 4 sets of 8 reps.If you can perform 4 sets of 8 reps of chin ups, move on to pull ups until you canperform 4 sets of 8-12.If you can perform 4 sets of 8-12 reps of pull ups move on to one arm assistedchin ups and pull ups until you can perform 2 sets of 6 reps for both of them.Then you will be able to do one arm chin ups if you lock down the technique.3) Squat variations (Leg movements)Great exercises to build your legs and core.The squat progress in this program is as follows :-Calf raises ( i assume you can do calf raises so i will not mention them)-Regular squats-Single leg glute bridges-90 degree/chair pistol squats-Pistol squats-Nordic curlsThe “with which one should I start” answer.If you can not perform 15 reps of regular squats you should start with them untilyou can perform 4 sets of 15 reps.If you can do 4 sets of 15 reps of regular squats, move on to single leg glutebridges until you can perform 3 sets of 8 reps for each leg and then move on to90 degree pistol squats warming up with 2 sets of regular ones.If you can perform 4 sets of 6 reps of 90 degree pistol squats, move on to pistolsquats after warming up with 2-4 sets of regular ones and 1 set of 90 degreeones.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",395
Page 460,"4) Core movementsThe core movement progress in this program is as follows :-Crunches/Hyperextensions-Planks-Reverse planks/Knee raises/Side planks-Leg raises-Toes to bar-L sits / Back bridgesThe “with which one should I start” answer.If you can not perform 15 reps of crunches and hyperextensions you should startwith them until you can perform 4 sets of 12-15 reps for both.If you can do 4 sets of 15 reps of both, move on to planks until you can perform 3sets of 1 minute holds.If you can perform 3 sets of 1 minute holds for planks , move on to reverse planks, knee raises and side planks until you can perform 3 sets of 30 second holds forreverse and side planks and 4 sets of 12-15 reps for knee raises.From this point you’ll see how we’ll treat the rest of the core movements.The workout prescriptionFor this program, you’ll be alternating between two workouts:Workout A and Workout B.Week 1Monday : Workout AWednesday : Workout BFriday : Workout AWeek 2Monday : Workout BWednesday : Workout AFriday : Workout BThere are 9 levels that will be presented for these workouts.Choose your level based on what we discussed just now (the sets and reps youcan perform of the movements presented so far).ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",318

Page 524,"3.6 How to train when extremely busy.Stay in shape with only 30 minutes of exercise.A lot of times when i ask friendly clients how they got out of shape, a lot of timesthe answer was “i just didn’t have time for the gym man”.Of course this is the answer men give since women over complicate the exactsame answer to oblivion which is quite funny.We’ve all been super busy and most importantly we WILL be again and unlessyour job is physical labor you have to find 30 minutes a dayin totalin order toexercise.Realize this, you can still make gains by working out only for 20 - 30 minutes aday if you prioritize the right exercises and combine them in a specific way.The hands down most common pitfall most people get into when they try to get adecent workout in 20-30 minutes is that they are in a hurry.This is a one way ticket to injuries and ADHD through mega pumping adrenalineand cortisol.Just because your workouts will only take 20 to 30 minutes this does not meanthat you should be in a hurry.You should never try to “save time” on warm up or rest periods.You will snap something.We need to address 2 issues now.The first one is if you’ll be working out using your own bodyweight or weights?For this reason there will be two workout splits prescribed here. One for weightworkouts and one for bodyweight workouts.The second one is that if you workout at the gym, since this program is based onsaving time, you’ll be given multiple options in order to choose the least timeconsuming on a specific day in case the machines are taken by multiple peopleetc.ⒸHelios_Movement LLC",370

Cover the pots and bring to a boil. Reduce heat tolow and simmer for at least 6-12 hours ( add more water if needed). Once thebones have simmered and your broth is ready, you will need to strain the broththrough a strainer. Add as much sea salt as you want and you’re done.
